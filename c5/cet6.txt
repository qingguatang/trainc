Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 24 are based on the following passage.
Automation refers to the introduction of electronic control and automatic operation of productive machinery. It reduces the human factors, mental and physical, in production, and is designed to make possible the manufacture of more goods with fewer workers. The development of automation in American industry has been called the “Second Industrial Revolution”.
Labour’s concern over automation arises from uncertainty about the effects on employment, and fears of major changes in jobs. In the main, labour has taken the view that resistance to technical change is unfruitful. Eventually, the result of automation may well be an increase in employment, since it is expected that vast industries will grow up around manufacturing, maintaining, and repairing automation equipment. The interest of labour lies in bringing about the transition with a minimum of inconvenience and distress to the workers involved. Also, union spokesmen emphasize that the benefit of the increased production and lower costs made possible by automation should be shared by workers in the form of higher wages, more leisure, and improved living standards.
To protect the interests of their members in the era of automation, unions have adopted a number of new policies. One of these is the promotion of supplementary unemployment benefit plans. It is emphasized that since the employer involved in such a plan has a direct financial interest in preventing unemployment, he will have a strong drive for planning new installations so as to cause the least possible problems in jobs and job assignment. Some unions are working for dismissal pay agreements, requiring that permanently dismissed workers be paid a sum of money based on length of service. Another approach is the idea of the “improvement factor”, which calls for wage increases based on increases in productivity. It is possible, however, that labour will rely mainly on reduction in working time.
21.	Though labour worries about the effect of automation, it does not doubt that ________.
A) automation will eventually prevent unemployment
B) automation will help workers acquire new skills
C) automation will eventually benefit the workers no less that the employers
D) automation is a trend which cannot be stopped
22.	The idea of the “improvement factor” (Line 6, Para. 3) probably implies that ________.
A) wages should be paid on the basis of length of service
B) the benefit of increased production and lower costs should be shared by workers
C) supplementary unemployment benefit plans should be promoted
D) the transition to automation should be brought about with the minimum of inconvenience and distress to workers
23.	In order to get the full benefits of automation, labour will depend mostly on ________.
A) additional payment to the permanently dismissed workers
B) the increase of wages in proportion to the increase in productivity
C) shorter working hours and more leisure time
D) a strong drive for planning new installations
24.	Which of the following can best sum up the passage?
A) Advantages and disadvantages of automation.
B) Labour and the effects of automation.
C) Unemployment benefit plans and automation.
D) Social benefits of automation.
Questions 25 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The case for college has been accepted without question for more than a generation. All high school graduates ought to go, says conventional wisdom and statistical evidence, because college will help them earn more money, become “better” people, and learn to be more responsible citizens than those who don’t go.
But college has never been able to work its magic for everyone. And now that close to half our high school graduates are attending, those who don’t fit the pattern are becoming more numerous, and more obvious. College graduates are selling shoes and driving taxis; college students interfere with each other’s experiments and write false letters of recommendation in the intense competition for admission to graduate school. Others find no stimulation in their studies, and drop out-often encouraged by college administrators.
Some observers say the fault! Is with the young people themselves-they are spoiled and they are expecting too much. But that’s a condemnation of the students as a whole, and doesn’t explain all campus unhappiness. Others blame the state of the world, and they are partly right. We’ve been told that young people have to go to college because our economy can’t absorb an army of untrained eighteen-year-olds. But disappointed graduates are learning that it can no longer absorb an army of trained twenty-two-year-olds, either.
Some adventuresome educators and campus watchers have openly begun to suggest that college may not be the best, the proper, the only place for every young person after the completion of high school. We may have been looking at all those surveys and statistics upside down, it seems, and through the rosy glow of our own remembered college experiences. Perhaps college doesn’t make people intelligent, ambitious, happy, liberal, quick-learning people are merely the ones who have been attracted to college in the first place. And perhaps all those successful college graduates would have been successful whether they had gone to college or not. This is heresy (异端邪说) to those of us who have been brought up to believe that if a little schooling is good, more has to be much better. But contrary evidence is beginning to mount up.
25.	According to the passage, the author believes that ________.
A) people used to question the value of college education
B) people used to have full confidence in higher education
C) all high school graduates went to college
D) very few high school graduates chose to go to college
26.	In the 2nd paragraph, “those who don’t fit the pattern” refers to ________.
A) high school graduates who aren’t suitable for college education
B) college graduates who are selling shoes and driving taxis
C) college students who aren’t any better for their higher education
D) high school graduates who failed to be admitted to college
27.	The drop-out rate of college students seems to go up because ________.
A) young people are disappointed with the conventional way of teaching at college
B) many young people are required to join the army
C) young people have little motivation in pursuing a higher education
D) young people don’t like the intense competition for admission to graduate school
28.	According to the passage the problems of college education partly arise from the fact that ________.
A) society cannot provide enough jobs for properly trained college graduates
B) high school graduates do not fit the pattern of college education
C) too many students have to earn their own living
D) college administrators encourage students to drop out
29.	In this passage the author argues that ________.
A) more and more evidence shows college education may not be the best thing for high school graduates
B) college education is not enough if one wants to be successful
C) college education benefits only the intelligent, ambitious, and quick-learning people
D) intelligent people may learn quicker if they don’t go to college
30.	The “surveys and statistics” mentioned in the last paragraph might have shown that ________.
A) college-educated people are more successful than non-college-educated people
B) college education was not the first choice of intelligent people
C) the less schooling a person has the better it is for him
D) most people have sweet memories of college life
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Ours has become a society of employees. A hundred years or so ago only one out of every five Americans at work was employed, i.e., worked for somebody else. Today only one out of five is not employed but working for himself. And when fifty years ago “being employed” meant working as a factory labourer or as a farmhand, the employee of today is increasingly a middle-class person with a substantial formal education, holding a professional or management job requiring intellectual and technical skills. Indeed, two things have characterized American society during these fifty years: middle-class and upper-class employees have been the fastest-growing groups in our working population-growing so fast that the industrial worker, that oldest child of the Industrial Revolution, has been losing in numerical importance despite the expansion of industrial production.
Yet you will find little if anything written on what it is to be an employee. You can find a great deal of very dubious advice on how to get a job or how to get a promotion. You can also find a good deal of work in a chosen field, whether it be the mechanist’s trade or bookkeeping (簿记). Every one of these trades requires different skills, sets different standards, and requires a different preparation. Yet they all have employeeship in common. And increasingly, especially in the large business or in government, employeeship is more important to success than the special professional knowledge or skill. Certainly more people fail because they do not know the requirements of being an employee than because they do not adequately possess the skills of their trade; the higher you climb the ladder, the more you get into administrative or executive work, the greater the emphasis on ability to work within the organization rather than on technical abilities or professional knowledge.
31.	It is implied that fifty years ago ________.
A) eighty per cent of American working people were employed in factories
B) twenty per cent of American intellectuals were employees
C) the percentage of intellectuals in the total work force was almost the same as that of industrial workers
D) the percentage of intellectuals working as employees was not so large as that of industrial workers
32.	According to the passage, with the development of modern industry, ________.
A) factory labourers will overtake intellectual employees in number
B) there are as many middle-class employees as factory labourers
C) employers have attached great importance to factory labourers
D) the proportion of factory labourers in the total employee population has decreased
33.	The word “dubious” (L. 2, Para. 2) most probably means ________.
A) valuable
B) useful
C) doubtful
D) helpful
34.	According to the writer, professional knowledge or skill is ________.
A) less importance than awareness of being a good employee
B) as important as the ability to deal with public relations
C) more important than employer-employee relations
D) more important as the ability to co-operate with others in the organization
35.	From the passage it can be seen that employeeship helps one ________.
A) to be more successful in his career
B) to be more specialized in his field
C) to solve technical problems
D) to develop his professional skill
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
We all know that the normal human daily cycle of activity is of some 7-8 hours’ sleep alternation with some 16-17 hours’ wakefulness and that, broadly speaking, the sleep normally coincides with the hours of darkness. Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified.
The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to reversed routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on. This means that no sooner has he got used to one routine than he has to change to another, so that much of his time is spent neither working nor sleeping very efficiently.
The only real solution appears to be to hand over the night shift to a number of permanent night workers. An interesting study of the domestic life and health of night-shift workers was carried out by Brown in 1957. She found a high incidence (发生率) of disturbed sleep and other disorders among those on alternating day and night shifts, but no abnormal occurrence of these phenomena among those on permanent night work.
This latter system then appears to be the best long-term policy, but meanwhile something may be done to relieve the strains of alternate day and night work by selecting those people who can adapt most quickly to the changes of routine. One way of knowing when a person has adapted is by measuring his body temperature. People engaged in normal daytime work will have a high temperature during the hours of wakefulness and a low one at night; when they change to night work the pattern will only gradually go back to match the new routine and the speed with which it does so parallels, broadly speaking, the adaptation of the body as a whole, particularly in terms of performance. Therefore, by taking body temperature at intervals of two hours throughout the period of wakefulness it can be seen how quickly a person can adapt to a reversed routine, and this could be used as a basis for selection. So far, however, such a form of selection does not seem to have been applied in practice.
36.	Why is the question of “how easily people can get used to working at night” not a mere academic question?
A) Because few people like to reverse the cycle of sleep and wakefulness.
B) Because sleep normally coincides with the hours of darkness.
C) Because people are required to work at night in some fields of industry.
D) Because shift work in industry requires people to change their sleeping habits.
37.	The main problem of the round-the-clock working system lies in ________.
A) the inconveniences brought about to the workers by the introduction of automation
B) the disturbance of the daily life cycle of workers who have to change shifts too frequently
C) the fact that people working at night are often less effective
D) the fact that it is difficult to find a number of good night workers
38.	The best solution for implementing the 24-hour working system seems to be ________.
A) to change shifts at longer intervals
B) to have longer shifts
C) to arrange for some people to work on night shifts only
D) to create better living conditions for night workers
39.	It is possible to find out if a person has adapted to the changes of routine by measuring his body temperature because ________.
A) body temperature changes when the cycle of sleep and wakefulness alternates
B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back
C) the temperature reverses when the routine is changed
D) people have higher temperatures when they are working efficiently
40.	Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE?
A) Body temperature may serve as an indication of a worker’s performance.
B) The selection of a number of permanent night shift workers has proved to be the best solution to problems of the round-the-clock working system.
C) Taking body temperature at regular intervals can show how a person adapts to the changes of routine.
D) Disturbed sleep occurs less frequently among those on permanent night or day shifts.

Changes in the way people live bring about changes in the jobs that they do. More and more people live in towns and cities instead on farms (71) and in villages. Cities and states have to provide services city people want, such like more police protection, more hospitals, and more (72) schools. This means that more policemen, more nurses and technicians, and more teachers must be hired. Advances in technology has also (73) changed people’s lives. Dishwashers and washing machines do jobs that were once done by the hand. The widespread use of such electrical appliances (74) means that there is a need for servicemen to keep it running properly (75)
People are earning higher wages and salaries. This leads changes in (76) the way of life. As income goes down, people may not want more food to (77) eat or more clothes to wear. But they may want more and better care from doctors, dentists and hospitals. They are likely to travel more and to want more education. Nevertheless, many more jobs are available in (78) these services.
The government also affects the kind of works people do. The governments (79) of most countries spend huge sums of money for international (80) defense. They hire thousands of engineers, scientists, clerks, typists and secretaries to work on the many different aspects of defence.

Passage One
Strikes are very common in Britain. They are extremely harmful to its industries. In fact, there are other countries in Western Europe that lose more working days through strikes every year than Britain. The trouble with the strikes in Britain is that they occur in essential industries. There are over 495 unions in Britain. Some unions are very small. Over 20 have more than 100,000 members. Unions do not exist only to demand higher wages. They also educate their members. They provide benefits for the sick and try to improve working conditions. Trade unioners say that we must thank the unions for the great improvement in working conditions in the last hundred years. It is now against the law for union members to go on strike without the support of their union. This kind of strike is called the unofficial strike and was common until recently. Employers feel that unofficial strikes were most harmful because they would not be predicted. However, these unofficial strikes still occur from time to time and some unions have also refused to cooperate with the law. As a result, the general picture of the relations between workers and employers in Britain has gone from bad to worse.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	In what way are strikes in Britain different from those in other European countries?
12.	Why are British employers so afraid of unofficial strikes?
13.	What conclusion can be drawn from this passage?
Passage Two
Everywhere we look we see Americans running. They run for every reason anybody could think of.
They run for health, for beauty, to lose weight, to feel fit and because it’s the thing they love to do. Every year, for example, thousands upon thousands of people run in one race, the Boston Marathon, the best known long distance race in the United States. In recent years, there have been nearly 5,000 official competitors and it takes three whole minutes for the crowd of runners just to cross the starting line. You may have heard the story of the Greek runner Pheidippides. He ran from Marathon to Athens to deliver the news of the great victory 2,500 years ago. No one knows how long it took him to run the distance. But the story tells us that he died of the effort. Today no one will die in a Marathon race. But the effort is still enormous. Someone does come in first in this tiring foot race. But at the finish line we see what this race is about: not being first but finishing. The real victory is not over one’s fellow runners but over one’s own body. It’s a victory of will-power over fatigue. In the Boston Marathon each person who crosses that finish line is a winner.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What’s the real victory for the thousands of Marathon runners?
15.	Who is a winner in the competition?
16.	What happened to the ancient Greek runner Pheidippides?
Passage Three
Deep Springs is an American college. It is an unusual college. It is high in the white mountains in California not in a college town. The campus is a collection of old buildings with no beautiful classrooms. The only college-like thing about Deep Springs is its library. Students can study from the 17,000 books 24 hours a day. The library is never crowded as there are only 24 well-qualified male students at the college. In addition, there are only five full-time professors. These teachers believe in the idea of this college. They need to believe in it. They do not get much money. In fact, their salaries are only about 9,000 dollars a year plus room and meals. The schools gives the young teachers as well as the students something more important than money. “There is no place like Deep Springs,” says a second-year student from New York State, “Most colleges today are much the same but Deep Springs is not afraid to be different.” He says that students at his college are in a situation quite unlike in the other school. Students are there to learn and they cannot run away from problems. There is no place to escape to. At most colleges, students can close their book and go to a film. They can go out to restaurants or to parties. Deep Springs students have completely different alternatives. They can talk to each other or to their teachers. Another possible activity is to go to the library to study. They might decide to do some work. The students who doesn’t want to do any of these activities can go for a walk in the desert. Deep Springs is far from the world of restaurants and cinemas. There is not even a television set on campus.
Questions 17 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
17.	What is the total number of students at Deep Springs College?
18.	What is true of the campus of Deep Springs College?
19.	Which of the following is mentioned in the passage?
20.	What can students at Deep Springs do in their spare time?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
One day in January 1913. G. H. Hardy, a famous Cambridge University mathematician received a letter from an Indian named Srinivasa Ramanujan asking him for his opinion of 120 mathematical theorems (定理) that Ramanujan said he had discovered. To Hardy, many of the theorems made no sense. Of the others, one or two were already well-known. Ramanujan must be some kind of trickplayer, Hardy decided, and put the letter aside. But all that day the letter kept hanging round Hardy. Might there be something in those wild-looking theorems?
That evening Hardy invited another brilliant Cambridge mathematician, J. E. Littlewood, and the two men set out to assess the Indian’s worth. That incident was a turning point in the history of mathematics.
At the time, Ramanujan was an obscure Madras Port Trust clerk. A little more than a year later, he was at Cambridge University, and beginning to be recognized as one of the most amazing mathematicians the world has ever known. Though he died in 1920, much of his work was so far in advance of his time that only in recent years is it beginning to be properly understood.
Indeed, his results are helping solve today’s problems in computer science and physics, problems that he could have had no notion of.
For Indians, moreover, Ramanujan has a special significance. Ramanujan, though born in poor and ill-paid accountant’s family 100 years ago, has inspired many Indians to adopt mathematics as career.
Much of Ramanujan’s work is in number theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the subtle (难以捉摸的) laws and relationships that govern numbers. Mathematicians describe his results as elegant and beautiful but they are much too complex to be appreciated by laymen.
His life, though, is full of drama and sorrow. It is one of the great romantic stories of mathematics, a distressing reminder that genius can surface and rise in the most unpromising circumstances.
21.	When Hardy received the 120 theorems from Ramanujan, his attitude at first might be best described as ________.
A) uninterested
B) unsympathetic
C) suspicious
D) curious
22.	Ramanujan’s position in Cambridge University owed much to ________.
A) the judgement of his work by Hardy and Littlewood
B) his letter of application accepted by Hardy
C) his work as a clerk at Madras Port Trust
D) his being recognized by the world as a famous mathematician
23.	It may be inferred from the passage that the author ________.
A) feels sorry for Ramanujan’s early death
B) is dissatisfied with the slow development of computer science
C) is puzzled about the complexity of Ramanujan’s theorems
D) greatly appreciates Ramanujan’s mathematical genius
24.	In the last paragraph, the author points out that ________.
A) Ramanujan’s mathematical theorems were not appreciated by other mathematicians
B) extremely talented people can prove their worth despite difficult circumstances
C) Ramanujan also wrote a number of stories about mathematics
D) Ramanujan had worked out an elegant but complicated method of solving problems
25.	The word “laymen” (Last Para, Lind 6) most probably means ________.
A) people who do not specialize in mathematical science
B) people who are careless
C) people who are not interested in mathematics
D) people who don’t like to solve complicated problems
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Even if all the technical and intellectual problems can be solved, there are major social problems inherent in the computer revolution. The most obvious is unemployment, since the basic purpose of commercial computerization is to get more work done by fewer people. One
British study predicts that “automation induced unemployment” in Western Europe could reach
16~, 6 in the next decade, but most analyses are more optimistic. The general rule seems to be that new technology eventually creates as many jobs as it destroys, and often more. “People who put in computers usually increase their staffs as well” says CPT’s Scheff. “Of course,” he adds, “one industry may kill another industry. That’s tough on some people.”
Theoretically, all unemployed workers can be retrained, but retraining programs are not high on the nation’s agenda (议事日程). Many new jobs, moreover, will require an ability in using computers, and the retraining needed to use them will have to be repeated as the technology keeps improving. Says a chilling report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment:
“Lifelong retraining is expected to become the standard for many people. “There is a already considerable evidence that the school children now being educated in the use of computers are generally the children of the white middle class. Young blacks, whose unemployment rate stands today at 50 96, will find another barrier in front of them.
Such social problems are not the fault of the computer, of course, but a consequence of the way the American society might use the computer. “Even in the days of the Big, main-frame computers, when they were a machine for the few.” says Katherine Davis Fishman, author of
The Computer Establishment, “it was a tool to help the rich get richer. It still is to a large extent. One of the great values of the personal computer is that smaller firms, smaller organizations can now have some of the advantages of the bigger organizations.”
26.	The closest restatement of “one industry may kill another industry” (Para. 1 Line 11) is that ________.
A) industries tend to compete with one another
B) one industry might be driven out of business by another industry
C) one industry may increase its staff at the expense of another
D) industries tend to combine into bigger ones
27.	The word “chilling” (Para. 2, Line 5) most probably means ________.
A) misleading
B) convincing
C) discouraging
D) interesting
28.	Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?
A) Computers are efficient in retraining unemployed workers.
B) Computers may offer more working opportunities than they destroy.
C) Computers will increase the unemployment rate of young blacks.
D) Computers can help smaller organizations to function more effectively.
29.	From the passage it can be inferred that ________.
A) all school children are offered a course in the use of computers
B) all unemployed workers are being retrained
C) retraining programmes are considered very important by the government
D) in reality only a certain portion of unemployed workers will be retrained
30.	The major problem discussed in the passage is ________.
A) the importance of lifelong retraining of the unemployed workers
B) the social consequences of the widespread use of computers in the United States
C) the barrier to the employment of young people
D) the general rule of the advancement of technology
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Mobility of individual members and family groups tends to split up family relationships.
Occasionally the movement of a family away from a situation which has been the source of friction results in greater family organization, but on the whole mobility is disorganizing.
Individuals and families are involved in three types of mobility: movement in space, movement up or down in social status, and the movement of ideas. These are termed respectively spatial, vertical, and ideational mobility.
A great increase in spatial mobility has gone along with improvements in rail and water transportation, the invention and use of the automobile, and the availability of airplane passenger service. Spatial mobility results in a decline in the importance of the traditional home with its emphasis on family continuity and stability. It also means that when individual family members or the family as a whole move away from a community, the person or the family is removed from the pressures of relatives, friends, and community institutions for conventionality and stability. Even more important is the fact that spatial mobility permits some members of a family to come in contact with and possibly adopt attitudes, values, and ways of thinking different from those held by other family members. The presence of different attitudes, values, and ways of thinking with in a family may, and often does, result in conflict and family disorganization. Potential disorganization is present in those families in which the husband, wife, and children are spatially separated over a long period, or are living together but see each other only briefly because of different work schedules.
One index of the increase in vertical mobility is the great increase in the proportion of sons, and to some extent daughters, who engage in occupations other than those of the parents.
Another index of vertical mobility is the degree of intermarriage between racial classes. This occurs almost exclusively between classes which are adjacent to each other. Engaging in a different occupation, or intermarriage, like spatial mobility, allows one to come in contact with ways of behavior different from those of the parental home, and tends to separate parents and their children.
The increase in ideational mobility is measured by the increase in publications, such as newspapers, periodicals, and books, the increase in the percentage of the population owning radios, and the increase in television sets. All these tend to introduce new ideas into the home.
When individual family members are exposed to and adopt the new ideas, the tendency is for conflict to arise and for those in conflict to become psychologically separated from each other.
31.	What the passage tells us can be summarized by the statement:
A) social development results in a decline in the importance of traditional families
B) potential disorganization is present in the American family
C) family disorganization is more or less the result of mobility
D) the movement of a family is one of the factors in raising its social status
32.	According to the passage, those who live in a traditional family ________.
A) are less likely to quarrel with others because of conventionality and stability
B) have to depend on their relatives and friends if they do not move away from it
C) can get more help from their family members if they are in trouble
D) will have more freedom of action and thought if they move away from it
33.	Potential disorganization exists in those families in which ________.
A) the husband, wife, and children work too hard
B) the husband, wife, and children seldom get together
C) both parents have to work full time
D) the family members are subject to social pressures
34.	Intermarriage and different occupations play an important role in family disorganization because ________.
A) they enable the children to travel around without their parents’ permission
B) they allow one to find a good job and improve one’s social status
C) they enable the children to better understand the ways of behavior of their parents
D) they permit one to come into contact with different ways of behavior and thinking
35.	This passage suggests that a well-organized family is a family whose members ________.
A) are not psychologically withdrawn from one another
B) never quarrel with each other even when they disagree
C) often help each other with true love and affection
D) are exposed to the same new ideas introduced by books, radios, and TV sets
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
To call someone bird-brained in English means you think that person is silly or stupid.
But will this description soon disappear from use in the light of recent research? It seems the English may have been unfair in association bird’s brains with stupidity.
In an attempt to find out how different creatures see the world, psychologists at Brown University in the USA have been comparing the behaviour of birds and humans. One experiment has involved teaching pigeons to recognize letters of the English alphabet. The birds study in “classrooms”, which are boxes equipped with a computer. After about four days of studying a particular letter, the pigeon has to pick out that letter from several displayed on the computer screen. Three male pigeons have learnt to distinguish all twenty-six letters of the alphabet in this way.
A computer record of the birds’ four-month study period has shown surprising similarities between the pigeons’ and human performance. Pigeons and people find the same letters easy, or hard, to tell apart. For example, 92 per cent of the time the pigeons could tell the letter D from the letter Z. But when faced with U and V (often confused by English children), the pigeons were right only 34 per cent of the time.
The results of the experiments so far have led psychologists to conclude that pigeons and humans observe things in similar ways. This suggests that there is something fundamental about the recognition process. If scientists could only discover just what this recognition process is it could be very useful for computer designers. The disadvantage of a present computer is that it can only do what a human being has programmed it to do and the programmer must give the computer precise, logical instructions. Maybe in the future, though, computers will be able to think like human beings.
36.	The writer suggests that the expression “bird-brained” might be out of use soon because it is ________.
A) silly
B) impolite
C) unnecessary
D) inappropriate
37.	Psychologists have been experimenting with pigeons to find out whether the birds ________.
A) are really silly or stupid
B) can learn to make ideas known to people
C) see the world as human beings do
D) learn more quickly than children
38.	U and V are confused by ________.
A) 92 per cent of pigeons
B) many English children
C) most people learning English
D) 34 per cent of English children
39.	There are similarities in observing things by pigeons and humans ________.
A) because pigeons are taught by humans
B) because pigeons have brains more developed than other birds
C) because their basic ways to know the world are the same
D) because pigeons and humans have similar brains
40.	The research may help ________.
A) computer designers
B) computer salesmen
C) psychologists
D) teachers

Quite recently researchers have reviewed the causes of motion sickness and methods with which it may be suppressed. They concentrated first of all in motion sickness which develops in children (71) travelling in the back seat of cars.
A lot of children suffer terribly from car sick. What’s required is to provide the child with (72) the visual field he has in walk. So objects at (73) a distance in the center of the field remain stationary while those in the peripheral field appear to move. This can be achieved by positioning the child in a raised seat in the front of the car, that, of course, isn’t very (74) sensible in terms of safety.
Looking at the horizon is always beneficial to anyone develops sea sickness, because it’s the (75) only object which doesn’t move. If he is below deck, closing his eyes is helpful. It’s better to have no visual information but something which (76) results in conflict.
Taking drugs is one way to prevent motion sickness. In the fact, it’s interesting to note (77) that these have been excluded in medical kits (78) used in space flights.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage One
Merchant and passenger ships are generally required to have a life preserver for every person aboard and, in many cases, a certain percentage of smaller sizes for children. According to United States Coast Guard requirements, life preservers must be simple in design, reversible, capable of being quickly adjusted to fit the uninitiated individual, and must be so designed as to support the wearer in the water in an upright or slightly backward position.
Sufficient buoyancy (浮力) to support the wearer should be retained by the life preserver after 48 hour in the water, and it should be reliable even after long period of storage. Thus it should be made of materials resistant to sunlight, gasoline, and oils, and it should be not easily set on fire.
The position in which the life preserver will support a person who jumps or falls into the water is most important, as is its tendency to turn the wearer in the water from a face-down position to an upright or slightly backward position, with his face clear of the water, even when the wearer is exhausted or unconscious.
The method of adjustment to the body should be simple, and self-evident to uninitiated persons even in the dark under the confused conditions which follow a disaster. Thus, the life preserver should be reversible, so that it is nearly impossible to set it on wrong. Catches, straps, and ties should be kept to a minimum. In addition, the life preserver must be adjustable to the wide variety of shapes and sizes of wearers, since this greatly affects the position of floating and the self-righting qualities. A suitable life preserver should also be comfortable to wear at all times, in and out of the water, not so heavy as to encourage to take it off on shipboard while the ship is in danger, nor so burdensome that it hinders a person in the water while trying to swim.
21.	The passage is mainly about ________.
A) the uses of life preservers
B) the design of life preservers
C) the materials for life preservers
D) the buoyancy of life preservers
22.	According to the passage, a life preserver should be first of all, ________.
A) adjustable
B) comfortable
C) self-evident
D) self-righting
23.	United States Coast Guard does NOT require the life preserver to the made ________.
A) with as few strings as possible
B) capable of being worn on both sides
C) according to each wearer’s size
D) comfortable and light to wear
24.	By “the uninitiated individual” (Para. 1, line 6) the author refers to the person ________.
A) who has not been instructed how to use a life preserver
B) who has a little experience in using a life preserver
C) who uses a life preserver without permission
D) who becomes nervous before a disaster
25.	What would happen if a person were supported by the life preserver in a wrong position?
A) The waves would move him backwards.
B) The water would choke him.
C) He would immediately sink to the bottom.
D) He would be exhausted or unconscious.
Passage Two
A hundred years ago it was assumed and scientifically “proved” by economists that the laws of society made it necessary to have a vast army of poor and jobless people in order to keep the economy going. Today, hardly anybody would dare to voice this principle. It is generally accepted that nobody should be excluded from the wealth Western industrialized countries, a system of insurance has been introduced which guarantees everyone a minimum of subsistence (生活维持费) in case of unemployment, sickness and old age. I would go one step further and argue that, even if these conditions are not present, everyone has the right to receive the means to subsist (维持生活), in other words, he can claim this subsistence minimum without having to have any “reason”. I would suggest, however, that it should be limited to a definite period of time, let’s say two years, so as to avoid the encouraging of an abnormal attitude which refused any kind of social obligation.
This may sound like a fantastic proposal, but so, I think, our insurance system would have sounded to people a hundred years ago. The main objection to such a scheme would be that if each person were entitled to receive minimum support, people would not work. This assumption rests on the fallacy of the inherent laziness in human nature, actually, aside from abnormally lazy people, there would be very few who would not want to earn more than the minimum, and who would prefer to do nothing rather than work.
However, the suspicions against a system of guaranteed subsistence minimum are not groundless, from the standpoint of those who want to use ownership of capital for the purpose of forcing others to accept the work conditions they offer. If nobody were forced to accept work in order not to starve, work would have to be sufficiently interesting and attractive to induce one to accept it. Freedom of contract is possible only if both parties are free to accept and reject it; in the present capitalist system this is not the case.
But such a system would not only be the beginning of real freedom of contract between employers and employees, its principal advantage would be the improvement of freedom in inter-personal relationships in every sphere of daily life.
26.	People used to think that poverty and unemployment were due to ________.
A) the slow development of the economy
B) the poor and jobless people’s own faults
C) the lack of responsibility on the part of society
D) the large number of people who were not well-educated
27.	Now it is widely accepted that ________.
A) the present system of social insurance should be improved
B) everybody should be granted a minimum of subsistence without any “reason”
C) everybody has the right to share in the wealth of the country
D) people have to change their attitude towards the poor
28.	The writer argues that a system of social insurance should ________.
A) provide benefits for the sick, old and unemployed
B) encourage people to take on more social obligations
C) guarantee everyone the right to be employed
D) provide everyone with the right to a minimum subsistence for a certain period
29.	The word “fallacy” (Para. 2. L. 6) means ________.
A) doubt
B) fact
C) strong argument
D) wrong belief
30.	According to the writer, a system of guaranteed subsistence minimum ________.
A) demands too much from society
B) makes freedom of contract impossible
C) helps people take interest in their work
D) helps bring about changes in the relationship among people
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
The newborn can see the difference between various shapes and patterns from birth. He prefers patterns to dull or bright solid colors and looks longer at stripes and angles than at circular patterns. Within three weeks, however, his preference shifts dramatically to the human face.
Why should a baby with so little visual experience attend more to a human face than to any other kind of pattern’? Some scientists think this preference represents a built in advantage for the human species. The object of prime importance to the physically helpless infant is a human being. Babies seem to have a natural tendency to the human face as potentially rewarding. Researchers also point out that the newborn wisely relies more on pattern than on outline, size, or color. Pattern remains stable, while outline changes with point of view; size, with distance from an object; and brightness and color, with lighting.
Mothers have always claimed that they could see their newborns looking at them as they held them, despite what they have been told. The experts who thought that perception (知觉) had to await physical development and the consequence of action were wrong for several reasons. Earlier research techniques were less sophisticated than they are today. Physical skills were once used to indicate perception of objects-skills like visual tracking and reaching for an object, both of which the newborn does poorly. Then, too, assumptions that the newborn’s eye and brain were too immature for anything as sophisticated as pattern recognition caused opposing data to be thrown away. Since perception of form was widely believed to follow perception of more “basic” qualities such as color and brightness, the possibility of its presence from birth was rejected.
31.	What does a newborn baby like to see most’?
A) Bright colors.
B) Circular patterns.
C) Stripes and angles.
D) Various shapes.
32.	The newborn pays more attention to a human face than any other kind of objects because ________.
A) he sees a human face more often than any other kind of pattern
B) he has an inherent ability to regard a human being as helpful
C) a human face is the most complex pattern he can see
D) a human face is often accompanied by a pleasant voice
33.	Contrary to what they believe, mothers have been told that newborns ________.
A) care little about a human face
B) can’t track their movements
C) can’t see their faces
D) can easily perceive brightness
34.	In earlier researches on the newborn’s perception, scientists ________.
A) ignored evidence contrary to their assumptions
B) believed that perception of form comes before perception of color and brightness
C) opposed throwing away effective data
D) proved that physical skills come after visual perception
35.	The main idea of the passage is that ________.
A) research techniques are of vital importance scientific investigation
B) the findings of earlier scientific researchers often prove wrong
C) newborns can perceive forms from birth
D) more often than not the claims of mothers are reliable
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Albert Einstein recalled his learning problems philosophically: “My intellectual (智力的) development was slow, as a result of which I began to wonder about space and time only when I had already grown up. Naturally, I could go deeper into the problem than a child.” And so, 11 years after dismissal from school, young Albert Einstein published the theory of relativity that changed our understanding of the universe.
No one in this century has been more widely recognized as a genius than Einstein. Yet his problems with early intellectual development and his peculiar gifts cast great doubt on all our conventional ideas about genius, intelligence or “I.Q.” (智商). On the one hand, Einstein showed early defects in abilities that our mental tests value; on the other hand, his special intellectual faculties went far beyond most definitions of intelligence. Moreover, their growth appears peculiarly gradual, contradicting the popular conception of intelligence as something inborn and fixed. His resolute persistence and his skills in playing games with ideas were apparently as decisive to his genius as any cutting edge of intellect (智能).
These powerful aspects of intelligence that conventional definitions overlook are getting close attention in a new wave of research. This comes after years of earlier studies which exposed the narrowness of our usual measures of mental ability. Intelligence, it turns out, is multifaceted and marvelous; it includes personal characteristics, creativity skills and intellectual capabilities that show up on no test. What is most exciting is that some of these iii-defined abilities are possessed by many people. Just knowing about such neglected skills will help us discover and develop untapped (未开发的) potential-in ourselves and in our children.
36.	This passage is about ________.
A) the development of Einstein’s intellect
B) the wide recognition of Einstein as a genius
C) conventional ideas concerning genius
D) an insight to the complexity of human intelligence

A) fell behind other pupils

D) thought more deeply about the problems of space and time than his classmates
38.	Which of the following led to Einstein’s success?
A) His good skills in game-playing.
B) His diligence and powerful mind.
C) His unusual insight into the conception of intelligence.
D) His decisiveness in taking actions.
39.	“Multifaceted” (Para. 3, Line 6) probably means ________.
A) having many aspects
B) having many abilities
C) having many skills
D) having many uses
40.	According to the passage which of the following statements is TRUE’?
A) Conventional intelligence tests are not reliable.
B) For ordinary people intelligence is something inborn and fixed.
C) Einstein was apparently a genius in playing games as well as in scientific research.
D) Einstein’s early defects in abilities contributed to his later mental development.

By the time of the Civil War, there were many differences between the North and the South.
For instance, the population of the (71) North was far greater than of the South. (72) Twenty-two million people lived in the North; nine million lived in the South. To the nine million people in the South, more than three million were (73) slaves, many of whom would fight for the North.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
It is natural for young people to be critical of their parents at times and to blame them for most of the misunderstandings between them. They have always complained, more or less justly, that their parents are out of touch with modern ways; that they are possessive and dominant that they do not trust their children to deal with crises; that they talk too much about certain problems and that they have no sense of humour, at least in parent-child relationships.
I think it is true that parents often underestimate their teenage children and also forget how they themselves felt when young.
Young people often irritate their parents with their choices in clothes and hairstyles, in entertainers and music. This is not their motive. They feel cut off from the adult world into which they have not yet been accepted. So they create a culture and society of their own. Then, if it turns out that their music or entertainers or vocabulary or clothes or hairstyles irritate their parents, this gives them additional enjoyment. They feel they are superior, at least in a small way, and that they are leaders in style and taste.
Sometimes you are resistant, and proud because you do not want your parents to approve of what you do. If they did approve, it looks as if you are betraying your own age group. But in that case, you are assuming that you are the underdog: you can’t win but at least you can keep your honour. This is a passive way of looking at things. It is natural enough after long years of childhood, when you were completely under your parents’ control. But it ignores the fact that you are now beginning to be responsible for yourself.
If you plan to control your life, co-operation can be part of that plan. You can charm others, especially parents, into doing things the ways you want. You can impress others with your sense of responsibility and initiative, so that they will give you the authority to do what you want to do.

A) parents of teenagers

D) have a desire to be independent

Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The long years of food shortage in this country have suddenly given way to apparent abundance. Stores and shops are choked with food. Rationing (定量供应) is virtually suspended, and overseas suppliers have been asked to hold back deliveries. Yet, instead of joy, there is widespread uneasiness and confusion. Why do food prices keep on rising, when there seems to be so much more food about? Is the abundance only temporary, or has it come to stay? Does it mean that we need to think less now about producing more food at home? No one knows what to expect.
The recent growth of export surpluses on the world food market has certainly been unexpectedly great, partly because a strange sequence of two successful grain harvests. North America is now being followed by a third. Most of Britain’s overseas suppliers of meat, too, are offering more this year and home production has also risen.
But the effect of all this on the food situation in this country has been made worse by a simultaneous rise in food prices, due chiefly to the gradual cutting down of government support for food. The shops are overstocked with food not only because there is more food available, but also because people, frightened by high prices, are buying less of it.
Moreover, the rise in domestic prices has come at a time when world prices have begun to fall, with the result that imported food, with the exception of grain, is often cheaper than the home-produced variety. And now grain prices, too, are falling. Consumers are beginning to ask why they should not be enabled to benefit from this trend.
The significance of these developments is not lost on farmers. The older generation have seen it all happen before. Despite the present price and market guarantees, farmers fear they are about to be squeezed between cheap food imports and a shrinking home market. Present production is running at 51 per cent above pre-war levels, and the government has called for an expansion to 60 per cent by 1956; but repeated Ministerial advice is carrying little weight and the expansion programme is not working very well.
26.	Why is there “wide-spread uneasiness and confusion about the food situation in Britain?”
A) The abundant food supply is not expected to last.
B) Britain is importing less food.
C) Despite the abundance, food prices keep rising.
D) Britain will cut back on its production of food.
27.	The main reason for the rise in food prices is that ________.
A) people are buying less food
B) the government is providing less financial support for agriculture
C) domestic food production has decreased
D) imported food is driving prices higher
28.	Why didn’t the government’s expansion programme work very well?
A) Because the farmers were uncertain about the financial support the government guaranteed.
B) Because the farmers were uncertain about the benefits of expanding production.
C) Because the farmers were uncertain about whether foreign markets could be found for their produce.
D) Because the older generation of farmers were strongly against the programmer.
29.	The decrease in world food price was a result of ________.
A) a sharp fall in the purchasing power of the consumers
B) a sharp fall in the cost of food production
C) the overproduction of food in the food-importing countries
D) the overproduction on the part of the main food-exporting countries
30.	What did the future look like for Britain’s food production at the time this article was written?
A) The fall in world food prices would benefit British food producers.
B) An expansion of food production was at hand.

Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
It is hard to predict how science is going to turn out, and if it is really good science it is impossible to predict. If the things to be found are actually new, they are by definition unknown in advance. You cannot make choices in this matter. You either have science or you don’t, and if you have it you are obliged to accept the surprising and disturbing pieces of information, along with the neat and promptly useful bits.
The only solid piece of scientific truth about which I feel totally confident is that we are profoundly ignorant about nature. Indeed, I regard this as the major discovery of the past hundred years of biology. It is, in its way, an illumination piece of news. It would have amazed the brightest minds of the 18th century Enlightenment (启蒙运动) to be told by any of us how little we know and how bewildering seems the way ahead. It is this sudden confrontation with the depth and scope of ignorance that represents the most significant contribution of the 20th century science to the human intellect. In earlier times, we either pretended to understand how things worked or ignored the problem, or simply made up stories to fill the gaps. Now that we have begun exploring in earnest, we are getting glimpses of how huge the questions are, and how far from being answered. Because of this, we are depressed. It is not so bad being ignorant if you are totally ignorant; the hard thing is knowing in some detail the reality of ignorance, the worst spots and here and there the not-so-bad spots, but no true light at the end of the tunnel nor even any tunnels that can yet be trusted.
But we are making a beginning, and there ought to be some satisfaction. There are probably no questions we can think up that can’t be answered, sooner or later, including even the matter of consciousness. To be sure, there may well be questions we can’t think up, ever, and therefore limits to the reach of human intellect, but that is another matter. Within our limits, we should be able to work our way through to all our answers, if we keep at it long enough, and pay attention.
31.	According to the author, really good science ________.
A) would surprise the brightest minds of the 18th century Enlightenment
B) will produce results which cannot be foreseen
C) will help people to make the right choice in advance
D) will bring about disturbing results
32.	It can be inferred from the passage that scientists of the 18th century ________.
A) thought that they knew a great deal and could solve most problems of science
B) were afraid of facing up to the realities of scientific research
C) knew that they were ignorant and wanted to know more about nature
D) did more harm than good in promoting man’s understanding of nature
33.	Which of the following statements is NOT true of scientists in earlier times?
A) They invented false theories to explain things they didn’t understand.
B) They falsely claimed to know all about nature.
C) They did not believe in results from scientific observation.
D) They paid little attention to the problems they didn’t understand.
34.	What is the author’s attitude towards science?
A) He is depressed because of the ignorance of scientists.
B) He is doubtful because of the enormous difficulties confronting it.
C) He is confident though he is aware of the enormous difficulties confronting it.
D) He is delighted because of the illuminating scientific findings.
35.	The author believes that ________.
A) man can find solutions to whatever questions concerning nature he can think up
B) man can not solve all the problems he can think up because of the limits of human intellect
C) sooner or later man can think up all the questions concerning nature and answer them
D) questions concerning consciousness are outside the scope of scientific researchD
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Greenspace facilities are contributing to an important extent to the quality of the urban environment. Fortunately it is no longer necessary that every lecture or every book about this subject has to start with the proof of this idea. At present, it is generally accepted, although more as a self-evident statement than on the base of a closely-reasoned scientific proof. The recognition of the importance of greenspaces in the urban environment is a first step on the right way, this does not mean, however, that sufficient details are known about the functions of greenspace in towns and about the way in which the inhabitants are using these spaces. As to this rather complex subject I shall, within the scope of this lecture, enter into one aspect only, namely the recreative function of greenspace facilities.
The theoretical separation of living, working, traffic and recreation which for many years has been used in town-and-country planning, has in my opinion resulted in disproportionate attention for forms of recreation far from home, whereas there was relatively little attention for improvement of recreative possibilities in the direct neighbourhood of the home. We have come to the conclusion that this is not right, because an important part of the time which we do not pass in sleeping or working, is used for activities at and around home. So it is obvious that recreation in the open air has to begin at the street-door of the house. The urban environment has to offer as many recreation activities as possible, and the design of these has to be such that more obligatory activities can also have a recreative aspect.
The very best standard of living is nothing if it is not possible to take a pleasant walk in the district, if the children cannot be allowed to play in the streets, because the risks of traffic are too great, if during shopping you can nowhere find a spot for enjoying for a moment the nice weather, in short, if you only feel yourself at home after the street-door of your house is closed after you.
36.	According to the author, the importance of greenspaces in the urban environment ________.
A) is still unknown
B) is usually neglected
C) is being closely studied
D) has been fully recognized
37.	The theoretical separation of living, working, traffic and recreation has led to ________.
A) the disproportion of recreation facilities in the neighbourhood
B) the location of recreation facilities far from home
C) relatively little attention for recreative possibilities
D) the improvement of recreative possibilities in the neighbourhood
38.	The author suggests that the recreative possibilities of green space should be provided ________.
A) in special areas
B) in the suburbs
C) in the neighbourhood of the house
D) in gardens and parks
39.	According to the author, greenspace facilities should be designed in such a way that ________.
A) more obligatory activities might take on a recreative aspect
B) more and more people might have access to them
C) an increasing number of recreative activities might be developed
D) recreative activities might be brought into our homes
40.	The main idea of this passage is that ________.
A) better use of greenspace facilities should be made so as to improve the quality of our life
B) attention must be directed to the improvement of recreative possibilities
C) the urban environment is providing more recreation activities than it did many years ago
D) priority must be given to the development of obligatory activities

Traditionally, the American farmer has always been independent and hard-working. In the eighteenth century farmers were quite self-sufficient. The farm family grew and made almost nothing it needed. The surplus crop (71) would be sold to buy a few items in the local general store.
In 1860, because some of the farm population had (72) moved to the city, yet eighty percent of the American population was still in the country. In the late nineteen century, farm work and life were not much changed from that they had been in the old days. The farmer aroused at (74) dawn or before and had much work to do, with his own muscles like his chief source of power. He used axes, (76) spades and other complicated tools. In his house cooking (77) was done in wood-burning stoves, and the kerosene lamp was the only improvement on the candle. The family’s recreation and social life chiefly consisted a drive in the (78) wagon to the nearby small town or village to transact some business as well as to chat with neighbors who had also come to town. The children attended a small elementary school (often of just one room) to that they had to walk (79) every day, possibly for a few miles. The school term was short so that the children could not help on the farm. (80)
Although the whole family worked, and life was not easy, farmers as a class were self-reliant and independent.

The graph shows the changing rate of car accidents in Walton city in 1990. The first two months of 1990 showed an increasing trend. The rate rose to 32 in March but fell to 26 in June. From June on the rate was rising again and reached the peak point 39 in August. After August the rate began to decline, and eventually dropped to the lowest point 16 at the end of the year.
The highest rate in August was due to unfavorable weather conditions. Humidity and high temperature make drivers impatient, which easily leads to car accidents. The high rate in the first half of 1990 was also caused by the bad weather condition. In Walton City the excessive rain comes at early spring. The rain made road slippery, which often resulted in car accidents.
This year the pattern is expected to change. The city government has raised fund to improve the road condition. Two new roads will be finished at the beginning of this year and are expected to open to traffic soon. Furthermore, the new road regulation provides that in summer every car must be air-conditioned. With all these precautions, I’m sure that the rate of car accidents will be much lower this year.

Passage One
In recent years, many Americans of both sexes and various ages have become interested in improving their bodies. They have become devoted to physical fitness.
Many persons have a strong desire to be more physically fit. By nature, Americans are enthusiastic and energetic about hobbies or pastimes.
Many of them apply this enthusiasm, optimism, and energy to running. As a result, there are running clubs to join and numerous books and magazines to read about running.
The desire to be physically fit is explained by a “passion” for good health. The high rate of heart attacks in the 1960s caused an increase of interest in improving the human body.
Middle-aged men especially suffer from heart attacks. Thus, they are one group strongly interested in more physical exercises. In fact, many doctors encourage their patients to become more physically active, especially those who have inactive jobs. It is interesting to note that the rate of heart attacks began to decease between 1972 and 1974 and it is still decreasing. Physical fitness has now become a new “love” of Americans. Will it last long? Only time will tell-or until another “new passion” comes along?
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	Why are Americans so interested in physical exercises?
12.	What about the rate of heart attacks between 1972 and 1974 in the United States?

Telephone books in the United States have white, blue and yellow pages.
The white pages list people with phones by last name. The blue pages contain numbers of city services, government agencies, and public schools. Businesses and professional services are listed in special section-the Yellow Pages.
To make a long distance call, you need an area code. Each area in the U.S. has an area code. The area covered by one are code may be small or large. For example, New York City has one area code, but so does the whole state of Oregon. If you want to know the area code of a place, you can look it up in the area code map which is printed in the front of the white pages.
There are a lot of public telephones in the U.S.. They have their own numbers. If you are making a long distance call on a public telephone and run out of money, give the number on your phone to the person you’re talking to. Then hang up the receiver and he can call you back. If you make a long distance call and get a wrong number, call the operator and explain what happened. This means that you can make the call again to the right number without having to pay more money.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	Where can you find the telephone number of a city council in the telephone book?
15.	Where can you find an area code map of the U.S.?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Lecturing as a method of teaching is so frequently under attack today from educational psychologists and by students that some justification is needed to keep it. Critics believe that is results in passive methods of learning which tend to be less effective than those which fully engage the learner. They also maintain that students have no opportunity to ask questions and must all receive the same content at the same pace, that they are exposed only to one teacher’s interpretation of subject matter which will certainly be limited and that, anyway, few lectures rise above dullness. Nevertheless, in a number of inquiries this pessimistic evaluation of lecturing as a teaching method proves not to be general among students although they do fairly often comment on poor lecturing techniques.
Students praise lectures which are clear and orderly outlines in which basic principles are emphasized but dislike too numerous digressions (离题) or lectures which consist in part of the contents of a textbook. Students of science subjects consider that a lecture is a good way to introduce a new subject, putting it in its value as a period of discussion of problems and possible solutions with their lecturer. They do not look for inspiration (灵感)—this is more commonly mentioned by teachers—but arts students look for originality in lectures. Medical and dental students who have reports on teaching methods, or specifically on lecturing, suggest that there should be fewer lectures or that, at the least, more would be unpopular.
21.	The passage states that ________.
A) few students dislike lecturing as a teaching method
B) lecturing is a good method of teaching
C) lecturing as a teaching method proves to be uninspiring

23.	According to this passage, students dislike lectures which ________.
A) introduce mat la[ not included in the textbook
B) present many problems for discussion
C) always wander from the subject
D) stress the main points
24.	Lecturing as a teaching method is less appreciated by ________.
A) dental teachers
B) medical students
C) arts lecturers
D) science learners
25.	According to the author, the evaluation of lecturing as a teaching method by educational psychologists is ________.
A) defensive
B) conservative
C) realistic
D) negative
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions. It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating, and which are to be avoided when to attack and when to run away. The animal is, in effect, playing a complicated and potentially very dangerous game with its environment, discomfort or destruction.
This is a difficult and unpleasant business and few animals would survive if they had to start from the beginning and learn about the world wholly by trial and error, for there are the have possible decisions which would prove fatal. So we find, in practice, that the game is always arranged in favour of the young animal in one way or another. Either the animal is protected during the early stages of its learning about the world around it, or the knowledge of which way to respond is built into its nervous system from the start.
The fact that animals behave sensibly can be attributed partly to what we might call genetic (遗传的) learning, to distinguish it from the individual learning that an animal does in the course of its own life time. Genetic learning is learning by a species as a whole, and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to behave in the right way. However, genetic learning depends upon a prediction that the future will more or less exactly resemble the past. The more variable individual experience is likely to be, the less efficient is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game. It is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning. In the great majority of animals, behaviour is a compound of individual experience and genetic learning to behave in particular ways.
26.	According to the first paragraph, the survival game is considered potentially very dangerous because ________.
A) animals are constantly threatened by attacks
B) wrong decisions will lead to the disappearance of a species
C) decisions made by an animal may turn out to be fatal
D) few animals can survive in their struggle with the environment
27.	It is implied but not directly stated in the passage that most animals ________.
A) are likely to make wrong decisions
B) have made correct decisions for their survival
C) depend entirely on their parents in learning about the world around them
D) survive by means of individual learning
28.	Genetic learning is effective only if ________.
A) the survival game is arranged in favour of the young animals
B) the animals can adapt themselves to the changing surroundings
C) circumstances remain more or less the same
D) the animals have varied individual experiences
29.	The best TITLE for this passage would be ________.
A) The Decision-Making Ability of Animals
B) Survival and Environment
C) Reward and Penalty for Animals
D) Behaviour and Survival
30.	How is genetic leaning achieved?
A) It is inherited from animals with keen observation.
B) It is passed down from those animals that behave in the correct way.
C) It is taught to the young generation.
D) It is learned by the new generation through trial and error.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Scientists, like other human beings, have their hopes and fears, their passions and disappointments and their strong emotions may sometimes interrupt the course of clear thinking and sound practice. But science is also self-correcting. The most fundamental principles and conclusions may be challenged. The steps in a reasoned argument must be set out for all to see.
Experiments must be capable of being carried out by other scientists. The history of science is full of cases where previously accepted theories have been entirely overthrown, to be replaced by new ideas which more adequately explain the data.
While there is an understandable inertia-usually lasting about one generation-such revolution in scientific thought are widely accepted as a necessary and desirable element of scientific progress. Indeed, the reasoned criticism of a prevailing belief is a service to the supporters of that belief; if they are incapable of defending it, they are well-advised to abandon it. This self-questioning and error-correcting aspect of the scientific method is its most striking property and sets it off from many other areas of human endeavor, such as religion and fine arts.
The idea of science as a method rather than as a body of knowledge is not widely appreciated outside of science, or indeed in some corridors inside of science. Vigorous criticism is constructive in science more than in some other areas of human endeavor because in it there are adequate standards of validity which can be agreed upon by competent scientists the world over.
The objective of such criticism is not to suppress but rather to encourage the advance of new ideas: those which survive a firm skeptical (怀疑的) examination have a fighting chance of being right, or at least useful.
31.	Science is self-correcting because its theories ________.
A) have to be revised constantly to conform with ideas which explain the data better
B) have reflected the most fundamental principles of nature
C) are, more often than not, based on inadequate data
D) must be set out for all to see
32.	It can be learned from the context that the word “inertia” (Para. 2, Line 1) most probably means ________.
A) strong resolution
B) unwillingness to change
C) a period of time
D) prevailing belief
33.	The “revolution in scientific thought” (Para. 2, Lind 2) refers to ________.
A) acceptance of the reasoned criticisms of prevailing scientific theories
B) the continuous overthrow of existing scientific theories
C) the adequate explanation of the data in prevailing scientific theories
D) the major discoveries that represent breakthroughs in the history of scientific progress
34.	The author says that the most striking property of the scientific method is its self-questioning and error-correcting aspect, because it is this aspect that ________.
A) is indispensable to the advance of science
B) is most widely appreciated by scientists
C) helps scientists to abandon anything they cannot defend
D) sets science off from many other areas of human endeavor
35.	The word “it” (Para. 3, Line 4) refers to “________.”
A) vigorous criticism
B) scientific method
C) human endeavor
D) science
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
My father’s reaction to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenues in New York City was immediate and definite: “You won’t catch me putting my money in there!” he declared. “Not in that glass box!”
Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I am convinced that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money.
In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity (实物) that could be carried, or stolen. Consequently, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to affirm the fact, however untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building’s design made it appear impenetrable the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol dwelt in the prevailing attitude toward money.
But that attitude toward money has of course changed. Excepting pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit.
A deficit (赤字) economy, accompanied by huge expansion, has led us to think of money as a product of the creative imagination. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service
-a service in which the most valuable element is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled hank.
Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture boasts of its imaginative powers. From this point of view it is hard to say where architecture ends and human assertion (人们的说法) begins.
36.	The main idea of this passage is that ________.
A) money is not as valuable as it was in the past
B) changes have taken place in both the appearance and the concept or banks
C) the architectural style of the older bank is superior to that of the modern bank
D) prejudice makes the older generation think that the modern bank is unreliable
37.	What are the attitudes of the older generation and the younger generation toward money?
A) The former thinks more of it than the latter.
B) The younger generation values money more than the older generation.
C) Both generations rely on the imaginative power of bankers to make money.
D) The former regards it as a real commodity while the latter considers it to be a means to produce more money.
38.	The word “tangible” (Para. 4 Line 3) refers to something ________.
A) that is precious
B) that is usable
C) that can be touched
D) that can be reproduced
39.	According to this passage, a modern banker should be ________.
A) ambitious and friendly
B) reliable and powerful
C) sensible and impenetrable
D) imaginative and creative
40.	It can be inferred from the passage that the author’s attitude towards the new trend in banking is ________.

This passage discusses one way methane (甲烷) gas is made. And it has something also to do with the work (71) of termites (白蚁).
Termites can ruin a health tree or a costly home. (72) They eat the wood. This causes the tree or building to collapse. But termites also have a useless purpose on (73) earth.
Nearly half of the methane in our atmosphere come from termites. Methane gas, by turn, makes (74) other gases. It also aids in the greenhouse effect, which keeps warm air close the earth. (75)
Scientist Pat Zimmerman made the discovery. He found that methane gas is given up when termites (76) digest their food. Zimmerman thinks that there are about 240,000,000 billion termites on earth.
They produce 8,000 billion cubic foot of methane (77) each year, he believes. That is half the number of gas drawn yearly from natural gas (78) wells in the U.S.
Perhaps we’ll treat termites for friends. (79) We’ll offer them a piece of our house, and they’ll offer us a new way to keep us warmly! (80)

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
What do Charles Darwin, Nicholas Copernicus and Frank J. Sulloway have in common?
The first two, of course, were revolutionary scientific thinkers: Copernicus established that the Earth revolves around the sun; Darwin discovered natural selection. And Sulloway? He’s a historian of science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has discovered something else these two men-and, indeed, most of the major pioneers in science over the last 400 years-have in common: they were, like Sulloway himself, preceded in birth by at least one other brother or sister. Birth order, he found, is the most reliable indicator of whether a scientist will embrace or attack radical new ideas.
The third of four children, Sulloway has spent 20 years searching out the birth order of 2,784 scientists who were on one side or the other of 28 scientific revolutions since the 16th century. He discovered that 23 of the 28 revolutions were led by later-borns.
Sulloway focused on the male-dominated world of science and the sole issue he measured was willingness to challenge established opinions. Those least likely to accept new theories were firstborns with younger brothers or sisters. The most radical were younger sons with at least one older brother.
According to Sulloway’s theory, firstborn children identify more readily with parental authority because, among other things, they are often put in charge of younger brothers or sisters.
Through this identification, firstborns absorb the norms (规范,准则) and values of society in ways that subsequent children do not. The older child gets responsibility. They younger one tests the limits, tries to see what he can get away with.
21.	What is the main idea of the passage?
A) Later-borns are more intelligent than firstborns.
B) Revolutionary thinkers tend to recognize the influence of birth order.
C) Major scientists always have something in common in their way of thinking.
D) One’s behaviour is often determined by birth order.
22.	The historian of science mentioned in the passage is of the family.
A) the youngest child
B) neither the eldest nor the youngest child
C) the only child
D) the eldest child
23.	The 2,784 scientists Sulloway studied ________.
A) had led 23 of the 28 scientific revolutions
B) were preceded in birth by at least one brother or sister
C) had either supported or opposed revolutionary ideas
D) had dominated the world of science for 400 years
24.	According to Sulloway’s theory, who is most likely to challenge established ideas of science?
A) The only son with younger sisters.
B) Those who identify more readily with parental authority.
C) The only child of a family.
D) A person with at least one older brother or sister.
25.	The author’s attitude towards Sulloway’s birth order theory is ________.
A) critical
B) defensive
C) neutral
D) inconsistent
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The individual mobility, convenience, and status given by the private passenger car offer a seemingly unbeatable attraction. In 1987, a record 126,000 cars rolled off assembly lines each working day, and close to 400 million vehicles choke up the world’s streets today.
But the car’s usefulness to the individual stands in sharp contrast to the costs and burdens that society must shoulder to provide an automobile-centered transportation system. Since the clays of Henry Ford, societies have made a steady stream of laws to protect drivers from each other and themselves, as well as to protect the general public from the unintended effects of massive automobile use. Law makers have struggled over the competing goals of unlimited mobility and the individual’s fight to be free of the noise, pollution, and physical dangers that the automobile often brings.
Prior to the seventies, the auto’s usefulness and assured role in society were hardly questioned. Even worries about uprising gas prices and future fuel availability subsided (减退) in the eighties almost as quickly as they had emerged. Car sales recovered, driving is up, and wealthy customers are once more shopping for high performance cars.
The motor vehicle industry’s apparent success in dealing with the challenges of the seventies has obscured the harmful long-term trends of automobile centered transportation. Rising gasoline consumption will before long put increased pressure on oil production capacities. In addition, as more and more people can afford their own cars and as mass motorization takes hold, traffic jam becomes a tough problem. And motor vehicles are important contributors to urban air pollution, acid rain, and global warming.
Society’s interest in fuel supply security, the integrity of its cities, and protection of the environment calls for a fundamental rethinking of the automobile’s role. Stricter fuel economy and pollution standards are the most obvious and immediate measures that can be adopted. But they can only be part of the answer. In the years ahead, the challenge will be to develop innovative (革新的) transportation policies.
26.	Which of the following is TRUE according to the first paragraph?
A) A good car indicates its owner’s high social position.
B) A good car allows its owner to travel free.
C) A car provides its owner with a sense of safety.
D) A car adds to its owner’s attractiveness.
27.	The phrase “rolled off assembly lines” (Para. 1, Lines 2-3) means ________.
A) “were turned out from factories”
B) “moved along production lines”
C) “moved along the streets”
D) “were lined up in the streets”
28.	The passage states that there is ________.
A) a sharp contrast between the cost and usefulness of the cars
B) a sharp contrast between the cost and performance of the cars
C) a sharp conflict between car drivers and traffic rules
D) a sharp contradiction between the convenience of car owners and the burdens of society
29.	It is implied that the auto’s assured role in society is ________.
A) threatened by the rising gas prices
B) challenged by a series of fundamental problems
C) protected by law
D) firmly established
30.	Stricter fuel economy and pollution standards are ________.
A) only part of the solution to massive automobile use
B) the best way to cope with the massive use of cars
C) innovative transportation policies
D) future policies of the automobile industry
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
While America’s grade-school and high-school system is coming under attack, one fact remains: U.S. universities are among the best in the world. Since World War II, American scientists-mostly working in universities or colleges-have won more than half of all Nobel Prizes in physics and medicine. Foreign students rush to the United States by the tens of thousands; last year they earned more than one quarter of the doctoral degrees awarded in the country. Yet while American universities produce great research and great graduate programme, they some-times pay little attention to the task that lies at their very core: the teaching of undergraduate students.
In an era of $20,000 academic years, college presidents can no longer afford to ignore the creeping rot at their core. In speeches and interviews the nation’s higher educators have rediscovered teaching. Robert Rosenzweig, president of the Association of American Universities, said: “Our organization was never very concerned about teaching. In the last 18 months, we have spent more time on undergraduate education than on any other subject.”
Despite such promising efforts, no one doubts that research still outranks teaching at the leading universities, not least because it is a surer and faster way to earn status. Some people don’t think it has to be that way. They argue that the reward system for college faculty can be changed, so that professors will be encouraged to devote more time and effort to teaching. They say that they are beginning to believe that the 1990s may come to be remembered as the decade of the undergraduate.
That would bring ‘it full circle. For more than two centuries after the founding of Harvard College in 1636, the instruction of undergraduate students was an essential condition of American higher education.
31.	Which of the following would be the best TITLE for this passage?
A) University Education in the U.S.
B) University Education Challenged
C) Teaching and Research in Universities
D) Undergraduate Teaching Rediscovered
32.	The first sentence in the second paragraph means that ________.
A) with a budget of $ 20,000, presidents find it difficult to keep their universities going
B) with the increase in fees, educators feel obliged to improve undergraduate teaching
C) with a $ 20,000 budget, presidents find it difficult to stop the creeping rot in their universities
D) with the decrease in fees, educators can’t afford to lay equal stress on both research and teaching
33.	According to paragraph 3, some people think that the reward system for teachers should be changed so that ________.
A) more emphasis will be laid on teaching
B) leading universities can further raise their status
C) effort can be directed to graduate instruction
D) the 1990’s will become a decade of the-undergraduate
34.	According to the passage, at the leading American universities ________.
A) research is declining in importance
B) teaching is now ranked above research
C) teaching is a sure way to gain position
D) more importance is attached to research than to teaching
35.	It is implied in the passage that about 150 years ago undergraduate instruction ________.
A) was already threatened by research work
B) began to be neglected in most universities
C) constituted the fundamental part of higher education
D) began to undergo rapid changes
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In the final years before the beginning of the Civil War, the view that the Negro was different, even inferior, was widely held in the United States. At Peoria, Illinois, in October 1854, Abraham Lincoln asked what stand the opponents of slavery should take regarding Negroes.
“Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass, of white people will not.
Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgement, is not the sole question, if indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded.
We cannot, then, make them equals.”
The Lincoln statement was clear and direct, and it doubtless represented the views of most Americans in the 1850’s. Most of those who heard him or read his speech were of the same opinion as he. In later years, the Peoria speech would be used by those who taught to damage Lincoln’s reputation as a champion of the rights of the Negro. In 1964, the White Citizens’ Councils reprinted portions of the speech in large advertisements in the daily press and insisted that Lincoln shared their views on the desirability of maintaining two distinct worlds of race.
Lincoln could not have overcome the nation’s strong inclination toward racial separation if he had tried. And he did not try very hard. When he set about forming Negro troops later, he was content not only to set Negroes apart in a unit called “U.S. Colored Troops, “but also to have Negro privates (列兵) receive $10 per month including clothing, while whites of the same rank received $13 per month plus clothing. Only the firm refusal of many Negro troops to accept unequal pay finally forced Congress to equalize compensation, for white and Negro soldiers.
The fight for union that became also a fight for freedom never became a fight for equality or for the creation of one racial world.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Protests at the use of animals in research have taken a new and fearful character in Britain with the attempted murder of two British scientists by the terrorist technique of the pre-planted car-bomb.
The research community will rightly be alarmed at these developments, which have two objectives: to arouse public attention and to frighten people working in research with animals. The first need is that everything should be done to identify those responsible for the crimes and to put them on trail. The Defence Research Society has taken the practical step of offering a reward of 10,000 pounds for information leading to those responsible, but past experience is not encouraging. People are unlikely to be tempted by such offers. The professional police will similarly be confronted by the usual problem of finding a needle in a haystack.
That is why the intellectual (知识分子) community in Britain and elsewhere must act more vigorously in its own defence. There are several steps that can be taken, of which the chief one is to demand of all the organizations that exist with the declared objectives of safeguarding the interests of animals that they should declare clearly where they stand on violence towards people. And it will not be enough for the chairmen and chairwomen of these organizations to utter placatory (安抚的) statements on behalf of all their members. These people should also undertake that it will be a test of continuing membership in their organizations that members and would be members should declare that they will take no part in acts of violence against human beings. Even such undertakings would not be fully effective: people, after all, can lie. But at least they would distinguish the organizations entitled to a continuing voice in the dialogue with the research community about the rights of animals in research from the organizations that deserve no say.
21.	The words “these developments” (Para. 2, Line 1) most probably refer to ________.
A) the acts of violence against scientists
B) the use of animals in research
C) the techniques of planting bombs in cars
D) the establishment of new animal protection organization
22.	Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?
A) The police abandoned their efforts to find the criminals.
B) The terrorists escaped with the help of their organizations.
C) The attempted murder caused grave anxiety among British scientists.
D) People sympathized murder caused grave anxiety among British scientists.
23.	The author’s purpose in writing his article is to demand that animal-protecting organizations ________.
A) declare their objectives clearly
B) give up the use of violence
C) continue the dialogue with the scientific community
D) help to find those responsible for the attempted murder
24.	In the author’s opinion ________.
A) since people can lie, the problem about their rights of scientists can’t be solved
B) animal-protecting organizations about be held responsible for acts of violence against scientists
C) animal protection organizations should be declared illegal
D) the scientists should take effective measures to protect themselves
25.	What does the word “they” (Para. 3, Line 3) refer to?
A) The animal-protecting organizations.
B) The organizations that will talk with the research community.
C) Those who support the use of animals in research.
D) Those who support the animal-protection organizations.
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The earlier type of suburb, which was most dependent on the railroad, had a special advantage that could be fully appreciated only after it had disappeared. These suburbs, spread out along a railroad line, were discontinuous and properly spaced; and without the aid of legislation (法规) they were limited in population as well as area; for the biggest rarely held as many as ten thousand people, and under five thousand was more usual. In 1950, for example, Bronxville, New York, a typical upper-class suburb, had 6,778 people, while Riverside, Illinois, founded as early as 1869, had only 9.153.
The size and scale of the suburb, that of neighborhood unit, was not entirely the result of its open planning, which favored low densities. Being served by a railroad line, with station stops from three to five miles apart, there was a natural limit to the spread of any particular community. House had to be sited “within easy walking distance of the railroad station,” as some old residents would point out; and only those wealthy enough to afford a horse and a carriage dared to penetrate farther into the open country.
Through its spaced station stops, the railroad suburb was at first kept from spreading or excessively increasing in numbers, for a natural greenbelt, often still under cultivation as park, gardens, remained between the suburbs and increased the available recreation area. Occasionally, in a few happy areas like Westchester, between 1915 and 1935 a parkway, like the Bronx River parkway, accompanied by continuous strip of park for pedestrian (散步的人) use, not yet overrun by a constant stream of urban traffic, added to the perfection of the whole suburban pattern. Whatever one might say of the social disadvantages this was in many ways a perfect physical environment. But it lasted less than a generation.
26.	What was the special advantage of the old type of suburb?
A) Its nearness to the railroad.
B) The vastness of its open space.
C) Its small size in area and population.
D) The high social status of its residents.
27.	The size of the old suburb was limited because ________.
A) people wanted to live near a railroad station
B) it was originally planned by railroad companies
C) there was a law governing the size of the suburb
D) local inhabitants didn’t like to out in the country
28.	“Happy areas” (Para. 3, Line 3) were areas where ________.
A) life was enjoyed by everyone
B) more roads were built to bypass the heavy traffic
C) a greenbelt was available solely for recreation
D) people could have lots of fun
29.	It is evident that the writer ________.
A) finds urban life uncomfortable
B) prefers life in the countryside
C) feels disappointed in the changes of suburbs
D) advocates the idea of returning to nature
30.	The topic discussed in the passage is “________”.
A) the size and scale of suburban neighborhood units
B) the advantage of old-type suburbs
C) the location of railroad stations
D) the concept of the suburban pattern
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Recent stories in the newspapers and magazines suggest that teaching and research contradict each other, that research plays too prominent a part in academic promotions, and that teaching is badly underemphasized. There is an element of truth in these statements, but they also ignore deeper and more important relationships.
Research experience is an essential element of hiring and promotion at a research university because it is the emphasis on research that distinguishes such a university from an arts college. Some professors, however, neglect teaching for research and that presents a problem.
Most research universities reward outstanding teaching, but the greatest recognition is usually given for achievements in research. Part of the reason is the difficulty of judging teaching. A highly responsible and tough professor is usually appreciated by top students who want to be challenged, but disliked by those whose records are less impressive. The mild professor gets overall ratings that are usually high, but there is a sense of disappointment in the part of the best students, exactly those for whom the system should present the greatest challenges. Thus, a university trying to promote professors primarily on the teaching qualities would have to confront this confusion.
As modern science moves faster, two forces are exerted on professor: one is the time needed to keep on with the profession; the other is the time needed to teach. The training of new scientists requires outstanding teaching at the research university as well as the arts college. Although scientists are usually “made” in the elementary schools, scientists can be “lost” by poor teaching at the college and graduate school levels. The solution is not to separate teaching and research, but to recognize that the combination is difficult but vital. The title of professor should be given only to those who profess, and it is perhaps time for universities to reserve it for those willing to be an earnest part of the community of scholars. Professor unwilling to teach can be called “distinguished research investigators” or something else.
The pace of modern science makes it increasingly difficult to be a great researcher and a great teacher. Yet many are described in just those terms. Those who say we can separate teaching and research simply do not understand the system but those who say the problem will disappear are not fulfilling their responsibilities.
31.	What idea does the author want to convey in the first paragraph?
A) It is wrong to overestimate the importance of teaching.
B) Teaching and research are contradictory to each other.
C) Research can never be emphasized too much.
D) The relationship between teaching and research should not be simplified.
32.	In academic promotions research universities still attach more importance to research partly because ________.
A) research improves the quality of teaching
B) students who want to be challenged appreciate research professors
C) it is difficult to evaluate teaching quality objectively
D) professor with achievements in research are usually responsible and tough
33.	According to the fourth paragraph, which of the following will the author probably agree with?
A) Distinguished professors at research universities should concentrate on research only.
B) The separation of teaching from research can lower the quality of future scientists.
C) It is of utmost importance to improve teaching in elementary schools in order to train new scientists.
D) The rapid developments of modern science make it impossible to combine teaching with research.
34.	The title of professor should be given only to those who, first and foremost, do ________.
A) teaching
B) field work
C) scientific research
D) investigation
35.	The phrase “the problem” (Para. 5, Line 3) refers to ________.

B) the combination of teaching with research
C) the separations of teaching from research
D) improving the status of research
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
I have had just about enough of being treated like a second-class citizen, simply because I happened to be that put upon member of society-a customer. The more I go into shops and hotels, banks and post offices, railway stations, airports and the like, the more I’m convinced that things are being run solely to suit the firm, the system, or the union. There seems to be a new motto (座右铭) for the so-called ‘service’ organization-Staff Before Service. How often, for example, have you queued for what seems like hours at the Post Office or the supermarket because there aren’t enough staff on duty at all the service counters? Surely in these days of high unemployment it must be possible to increase counter staff. Yet supermarkets, hinting darkly at higher prices, claim that bringing all their cash registers into operation at any time would increase expenses. And the Post Office says we cannot expect all their service counters to be occupied ‘at times when demand is low’.
It’s the same with hotels. Because waiters and kitchen staff must finish when it suits them, dining rooms close earlier or menu choice is diminished. As for us guests (and how the meaning of that word has been cut away little by little), we just have to put up with it. There’s also the nonsense of so many friendly hotel night porters having been gradually with drawn from service in the interests of ‘efficiency’ (i.e. profits) and replaced by coin-eating machines which supply everything from beer to medicine, not to mention the creeping threat of the tea-making set in your room: a kettle with teabags, milk bags sugar. Who wants to wake up to a raw teabag? I don’t, especially when I am paying for ‘service’.
Our only hope is to hammer our irritation whenever and wherever we can and, if all else fails, restore that other, older saying-Take Our Custom (买卖) Elsewhere.

A) not worthy of special treatment
B) not provided with proper service

A) the staff are less considerate than employers
B) customers are becoming more demanding
C) customers unwilling to pay extra money

38.	According to the author, long queues at counters are caused by ________.
A) the diminishing supply of good staff
B) lack of cooperation among staff
C) inefficient staff
D) deliberate understaffing

When you board a plane, a machine may soon be scanning more than your bags—it may be studying your face. A computer comes onto the market recently which (71) promises to be able to recognize faces at a glance from a video (72) camera.
The system, known as PRES, has many possible use in (73) different fields but the most prominent is like to be monitoring (74) crowds at airports for known terrorists. Such a task is far from the capabilities of a conventional image processor, which is too quick to be of practical use. Moreover, it is too easily (75) confused: if image of a face in its memory is only a frontal (76) view. For example, they might not recognize that same face (77) when presenting with a side view of the face. (78)
PARES relies in the new technology of neural (神经的) (79) networks. Like the brain, it has many interconnected memory “cells”, which work simultaneously rather than in sequence and thus greatly speed up the computation. And like the brain, the neural network can be trained to concentrate on essentials while ignoring of inessential matters-it can “learn” what’s (80) important and what isn’t. But the training is boring: an operator must patiently correct the computer’s mistakes.
Part V Writing (30 minutes)

As a matter of fact, he looked a lot like me, wearing an inexpensive suit that looked a couple of years old and driving an old car with a little rust the edges. I asked him what he was doing in these years and he said he was teaching business at a local community college. “Teaching business?” I exclaimed. I thought I heard you were in New York, making a fortune in stocks. David smiled, “Yes, I didn’t that until about five years ago. But I got out. The stress was giving you a stomachache and a bad heart. Besides, once I got into that business, I had to run just to keep up. I did not have any time to spend with my family. We are much happier now.” I shook my head. He had chosen every man’s ambition but he gave it up. I had always dreamed of having money.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
“There is a senseless notion that children grow up and leave home when they’re 18, and the truth is far from that,” says sociologist Larry Bumpass of the University of Wisconsin. Today, unexpected numbers of young adults are living with their parents, “There is a major shift in the middle class,” declares sociologist Allan Schnaiberg of Northwester University, whose son, 19, moved back in after an absence of eight months.
Analysts cite a variety of reasons for this return to the nest. The marriage age is rising, a condition that makes home and its pleasantness particularly attractive to young people. A high divorce rate and a declining remarriage rate are sending economically pressed and emotionally hurt survivors back to parental shelters. For some, the expense of an away-from-home college education has become so excessively great that many students now attend local schools. Even after graduation, young people find their wings clipped by skyrocketing housing costs.
Living at home, says Knighton, a school teacher, continues to give her security and moral support. Her mother agreed, “It’s ridiculous for the kids to pay all that money for rent. It makes sense for kids to stay at home.” But sharing the family home requires adjustments for all. There are the hassles over bathrooms, telephones and privacy (不受干扰的生活). Some families, however, manage the delicate balancing act. But for others, it proves too difficult. Michelle Del Turco, 24, has been home three times-and left three times. “What I considered a social drink, my dad considered an alcohol problem,” she explains. “He never liked anyone I dated (约会), so I either had to hide away or meet them at friends’ house.”
Just how long should adult children live with their parents before moving on? Most psychologists feel lengthy homecomings are a mistake. Children, struggling to establish separate identities, can end up with “a sense of inadequacy, defeat and failure.” And aging parents, who should be enjoying some financial and personal freedom, find themselves stuck with responsibilities. Many agree that brief visits, however, can work beneficially.
21.	According to the author, there was once a trend in the U.S. ________.
A) for young adults to leave their parents and live independently
B) for middle class young adults to stay with their parents
C) for married young adults to move back home after a lengthy absence
D) for young adults to get jobs nearby in order to live with their parents
22.	Which of the following does not account for young adults returning to the nest?
A) Young adults find housing costs too high.
B) Young adults are psychologically and intellectually immature.
C) Young adults seek parental comfort and moral support.
D) Quite a number of young adults attend local schools.
23.	One of the disadvantages of young adults returning to stay with their parents is that ________.
A) there will inevitably be inconveniences in every day life
B) most parents find it difficult to keep
C) the young adults tend to be overprotected by their parents
D) public opinion is against young adults staying with their parents
24.	The word “hassles” in the passage (Line 3, Para. 3) probably means ________.
A) agreements
B) worries
C) disadvantages
D) quarrels
25.	According to the passage what is the best for both parents and children?
A) They should adjust themselves to sharing the family expenses.
B) Children should leave their parents when they are grown-up.
C) Adult children should visit their parents from time to time.
D) Parents should support their adult children when they are in trouble.
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The word conservation has a thrifty (节俭) meaning. To conserve is to save and protect, to leave what we ourselves enjoy in such good condition that others may also share the enjoyment. Our forefathers had no idea that human population would increase faster than the supplies of raw materials; most of them, even until very recently, had the foolish idea that the treasures were “limitless” and “inexhaustible”. Most of the citizens of earlier generations knew little or nothing about the complicated and delicate system that runs all through nature, and which means that, as in a living body, an unhealthy condition of one part will sooner or later be harmful to all the others.
Fifty years ago nature study was not part of the school work; scientific forestry was a new idea; timber was still cheap because it could be brought in any quantity from distant woodlands; soil destruction and river floods were not national problems; nobody had yet studied long-terms climatic cycles in relation to proper land use; even the word “conservation” had nothing of the meaning that it has for us today.
For the sake of ourselves and those who will come after us, we must now set about repairing the mistakes of our forefathers. Conservation should, therefore, be made a part of everyone’s daily life. To know about the water table (水位) in the ground is just as important to us as a knowledge of the basic arithmetic formulas. We need to know why all watersheds (上游源头森林地带集水区) need the protection of plant life and why the running current of streams and rivers must be made to yield their full benefit to the soil before they finally escape to the sea. We need to be taught the duty of planting trees as well as of cutting them. We need to know the importance of big, mature trees, because living space for most of man’s fellow creatures on this planet is figured not only in square measure of surface but also in cubic volume above the earth. In brief, it should be our goal to restore as much of the original beauty of nature as we can.
26.	The author’s attitude towards the current situation in the exploitation of natural resources is ________.
A) positive
B) neutral
C) suspicious
D) critical
27.	According to the author, the greatest mistake of our forefathers was that ________.
A) they had no idea about scientific forestry
B) they had little or no sense of environmental protection
C) they were not aware of the significance of nature study
D) they had no idea of how to make good use of raw materials
28.	It can be inferred from the third paragraph that earlier generations didn’t realize ________.
A) the interdependence of water, soil, and living things
B) the importance of the proper use of land
C) the harmfulness of soil destruction and river floods
D) the value of the beauty of nature
29.	To avoid correcting the mistake of our forefathers, the author suggests that ________.
A) we plant more trees
B) natural science be taught to everybody
C) environmental education be directed toward everyone
D) we return to nature
30.	What does the author imply by saying “living space... is figured... also in cubic volume above the earth” (Lines 7-8, Para. 3)?
A) Our living space on the earth is getting smaller and smaller.
B) Our living space should be measured in cubic volume.
C) We need to take some measure to protect space.
D) We must preserve good living conditions for both birds and animals.
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Judging from recent surveys, most experts in sleep behavior agree that there is virtually an epidemic (流行病) of sleepiness in the nation. “I can’t think of a single study that hasn’t found Americans getting less sleep than they ought to,” says Dr. David. Even people who think they are sleeping enough would probably be better off with more rest.
The beginning of our sleep-deficit (睡眠不足) crisis can be traced to the invention of the light bulb a century ago. From diary entries and other personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have reached the conclusion that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night. “The best sleep habits once were forced on us, when we had nothing to do in the evening down on the farm, and it was dark.” By the 1950s and 1960s, the sleep schedule had been reduced dramatically, to between 7.5 and eight hours, and most people had to wake to an alarm clock. “People cheat on their sleep, and they don’t even realize they’re doing it,” says Dr. David. “They think they’re okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, when they really need 7.5, eight or even more to feel ideally vigorous.”
Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researchers say is the complexity of the day. Whenever pressures from work, family, friends and community mount, many people consider sleep the least expensive item on his programme. “In our society, you’re considered dynamic if you say you only need 5.5 hours’ sleep. If you’re got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition.”
To determine the consequences of sleep deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or recall a passage read to them only minutes earlier. “We’ve found that if you’re in sleep deficit, performance suffers,” says Dr. David. “Short-term memory is weakened, as are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate.”
31.	People in the 18th and 19th centuries used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night because they had ________.
A) no drive and ambition
B) no electric lighting
C) the best sleep habits
D) nothing to do in the evening
32.	According to Dr. David, Americans ________.
A) are ideally vigorous even under the pressure of life
B) often neglect the consequences of sleep deficit
C) do not know how to relax themselves properly
D) can get by on 6.5 hours of sleep
33.	Many Americans believe that ________.
A) sleep is the first thing that can be sacrificed when one is busy
B) they need more sleep to cope with the complexities of everyday life
C) to sleep is something one can do at any time of the day
D) enough sleep promotes people’s drive and ambition
34.	The word “subjects” (Line 1, Para. 4) refers to ________.
A) the performance tests used in the study of sleep deficit
B) special branches of knowledge that are being studied
C) people whose behavior or reactions are being studied
D) the psychological consequences of sleep deficit
35.	It can be concluded from the passage that one should sleep as many hours as is necessary to ________.
A) improve one’s memory dramatically
B) be considered dynamic by other people
C) maintain one’s daily schedule
D) feel energetic and perform adequately
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
The concept of personal choice in relation to health behaviors is an important one. An estimated 90 percent of all illness may be preventable if individuals would make sound personal health choices based upon current medical knowledge. We all enjoy our freedom of choice and do not like to see it restricted when it is within the legal and moral boundaries of society. The structure of American society allows us to make almost all our own personal decisions that may concern our health. If we so desire, we can smoke, drink excessively, refuse to wear seat belts, eat whatever food we want, and live a completely sedentary life-style without any exercise. The freedom to make such personal decisions is a fundamental aspect of our society, although the wisdom of these decisions can be questioned. Personal choices relative to health often cause a difficulty. As one example, a teenager may know the facts relative to smoking cigarettes and health but may be pressured by friends into believing it is the socially accepted thing to do.
A multitude of factors, both inherited and environmental, influence the development of health-related behaviors, and it is beyond the scope of this text to discuss all these factors as they may affect any given individual. However, the decision to adopt a particular health-related behavior is usually one of personal choice. There are healthy choices and there are unhealthy choices. In discussing the morals of personal choice, Fries and Crapo drew a comparison. They suggest that to knowingly give oneself over to a behavior that has a statistical probability of shortening life is similar to attempting suicide. Thus, for those individuals who are interested in preserving both the quality and quantity of life, personal health choices should reflect those behaviors that are associated with a statistical probability of increased vitality and longevity.
36.	The concept of personal choice concerning health is important because ________.
A) personal health choices help cure most illness
B) it helps raise the level of our medical knowledge
C) it is essential to personal freedom in American society
D) wrong decisions could lead to poor health

A) to “live an inactive life”
B) to “live a decent life”
C) to “live a life with complete freedom”
D) to “live a life of vice”
38.	Sound personal health choice is often difficult to make because ________.
A) current medical knowledge is still insufficient
B) there are many factors influencing our decisions
C) few people are willing to trade the quality of life
D) people are usually influenced by the behavior of their friends
39.	To knowingly allow oneself to purse unhealthy habits is compared by Fried and Crapo to ________.
A) improving the quality of one’s life
B) limiting one’s personal health choice
C) deliberately ending one’s life
D) breaking the rules of social behavior
40.	According to Fries and Crapo sound health choices should be based on ________.
A) personal decisions
B) society’s laws
C) statistical evidence
D) friends’ opinions

Living is risky. Crossing the road, driving a car, flying, swallowing an aspirin tablet or eating a chicken sandwich they can all be fatal. Clearly (71) some risks worth taking, especially when the rewards are high: a man surrounded by flames and smoke generally considers that jumping out of a second-floor window is an acceptable risk to save its life. But in medicine (72) a few procedures, drugs, operations or tests are really a matter of life and (73) death. There may be sound medicine reasons for accepting electrical (74) shock treatment, but such reasons are totally dependent in the balance of (75) risks and benefits for the patients.
Surgery for cancer may cure or prolong a life, but the removal of tonsils (扁桃体) cannot save anything a sore throat. Blood pressure drugs (76) definitely help some people live after a heart attack, but these same drugs may be both necessary and harmful for those with only mild blood pressure (77) problems.
Deciding how much discomfort and risk we are preparing to put up (78) with in the name of better health is a high personal matter, not a decision (79) we should remain to doctors alone. (80)
Part V Writing (30 minutes)

Passage One
Are you afraid to raise your hand in class, even when you know the answer? If you are, most people would say that you’re shy.
If you feel shy, you’re not alone. Nine out of ten people are at least a little shy. But however shy you are, scientific evidence seems to show that it isn’t your fault. You may have been born that way.
How do psychologists measure shyness? One way is by observation. They keep detailed records of people’s actions-like how often these people speak to others, or how long it takes someone to say hello to a stranger.
Another way to measure shyness is to ask people questions. The test only takes about 10 minutes. It asks questions like “Do you like going out a lot?” and “Do you have many friends?” People must answer either yes or no. These questions can predict how people actually behave in social situations. Suppose the test tells you that someone is shy. Chances are good that that person will act shy.
When scientists measure shyness, they’re really comparing degrees of shyness. In other words, when researchers say people are shy, they really mean they are more shy than others.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	Why does the speaker say that it isn’t a fault to be shy?
12.	What is one of the ways suggested by psychologists for measuring shyness?
13.	What is the purpose of the psychologists in asking questions?
Passage Two
When Midori was two years old, she often climbed onto the piano bench and reached for the violin that belonged to her mother, a 38-year-old professional musician.
“Please don’t touch, Midori,” her mother scolded. The violin was, after all, worth more than $20,000.
But Midori persisted, she longed to handle the graceful instrument that made beautiful sounds. Finally, on her third birthday, Midori was handed a package: a tiny violin, about half the normal size.
Almost from the moment Midori was born, her mother knew she was sensitive to music. For several years mother and daughter practised together day after day. She was eager to learn. Failure often led to tears, though she never once turned from the instrument. Instead, she persisted until the problem was overcome.
One day Johnston, an American musician, heard Midori playing the violin. He couldn’t believe she was just eight years old. “She must make a tape and I will take it to the United States.” the musician said.
A famous American violin teacher heard the tape. He, too, had difficulty believing his ears. The playing was absolutely astonishing. He immediately accepted her as a pupil and recommended her for a full scholarship. In 1982, Midori and her mother moved to New York City, leaving behind a comfortable life in Japan.
Questions 14 to 17 based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What was Midori’s mother?
15.	Why was Midori not allowed to touch her mother’s violin when she was only two years old?
16.	What did Johnston, the American, ask Midori to do?
17.	Why did Midori move to the United States?
Passage Three
The British Broadcasting Corporation is rejecting more and more candidates applying for jobs, because they suffer from hearing loss. And this is due to a wide use of personal stereo systems. According to officials at the corporation, about three per cent of them fail to win jobs for this reason. The figure indicates that people suffering from hearing defects are more common that a decade age.
Candidates applying for jobs at the British Broadcasting Corporation have always had hearing tests, but the techniques for such tests were not standardized until five years ago. The corporation says officially that there is no proof to link personal stereos with hearing disabilities, but frequent exposure to high level of sounds can diminish a person’s understanding of speech. That will rule out his chances of being a engineer taking care of sound quality in recording.
So exerts are now calling for manufactures of personal stereos to provide a warning light. It flashes when the sound is too loud. One British manufacturer accepted this suggestion. And this manufacturer has made a device which switches itself off when the level of sound is too high.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	Why do more and more candidates fail to get jobs at the British Broadcasting Corporation?
19.	When did the hearing test techniques become standardized?
20.	What suggestions did the experts make to stereo manufacturers.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
There are desert plants which survive the dry season in the form of inactive seeds. There are also desert insects which survive as inactive larvae (幼虫). In addition, difficult as it is to believe, there are desert fish which can survive through years of drought (干旱) in the form of inactive eggs. These are the shrimps (小虾) that live in the Mojave Desert, an intensely dry region in the south-west of the United States where shade temperatures of over 50C are often recorded.
The eggs of the Mojave shrimps are the size and have the appearance of grains of sand. When sufficient spring rain falls to form a lake, once every two to five years, these eggs hatch (孵化). Then the water is soon filled with millions of tiny shrimps about a millimetre long which feed on tiny plant and animal organisms which also grow in the temporary desert lake. Within a week, the shrimps grow from their original 1 millimetre to a length of about 1.5 centimetres.
Throughout the time that the shrimps are rapidly maturing, the water in the lake equally rapidly evaporates. Therefore, for the shrimps it is a race against time. By the twelfth day, however, when they are about 3 centimetre long, hundreds of tiny eggs form on the underbodies of the females. Usually by this time, all that remains of the lake is a large, muddy patch of wet soil. On the thirteenth day and the next, during the final hours of their brief lives, the shrimps lay their eggs in the mud. Then, having ensured that their species will survive, the shrimps die as the last of the water evaporates.
If sufficient rain falls the next year to form another lake, the eggs hatch, and once again the shrimps pass rapidly through their cycle of growth, adulthood, egg-laying, and death. Some years there is insufficient rain to form a lake: in this case, the eggs will remain dormant for another years, or even longer if necessary. Very, very occasionally, perhaps twice in a hundred years, sufficient rain falls to form a deep lake that lasts a month or more. In this case, the species passes through two cycles of growth, egg-laying, and death. Thus, on such occasions, the species multiplies considerably, which further ensures its survival.
21.	Which of the following is the MOST distinctive feature of Mojave shrimps?
A) Their lives are brief.
B) They feed on plant and animal organisms.
C) Their eggs can survive years of drought.
D) They lay their eggs in the mud.
22.	By saying “for the shrimps it is a race against time” (Para. 3, line 2) the author means ________.
A) they have to swim fast to avoid danger in the rapidly evaporating lake
B) they have to swim fast to catch the animal organisms on which they survive
C) they have to multiply as many as possible within thirteen days
D) they have to complete their life cycle within a short span of time permitted by the environment
23.	The passage mainly deals with ________.
A) the life span of the Mojave shrimps
B) the survival of desert shrimps
C) the importance of water to life
D) life in the Mojave Desert
24.	The word “dormant” (Para. 4, Line 3) most probably means ________.
A) inactive
B) strong
C) alert
D) soft
25.	It may be inferred from the passage that ________.
A) appearance and size are most important for life to survive in the desert
B) a species must be able to multiply quickly in order to survive
C) for some species one life cycle in a year is enough to survive the desert drought
D) some species develop a unique life pattern to survive in extremely harsh conditions
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Opportunities for rewarding work become fewer for both men and women as they grow older. After age 40, job hunting becomes even more difficult. Many workers stay at jobs they are too old for rather than face possible rejection. Our youth-oriented, throw-away culture sees little value in older people. In writer Lilian Hellman’s words, they have “the wisdom that comes with age that we can’t make use of. “
Unemployment and economic need for work is higher among older women, especially minorities, than among younger white women. A national council reports these findings: though unemployed longer when seeking work, older women job-hunt harder, hold a job longer with less absenteeism (缺勤), perform as well or better, are more reliable, and are more willing to learn than men or younger women. Yet many older women earn poor pay and face a future of poverty in their retirement years. When “sexism meets ageism, poverty is no longer on the doorstep it moves in,” according to Tish Sommers, director of a special study on older women for the National Organization for Women.
Yet a 1981 report on the White House Conference on Aging shows that as a group, older Americans are the “wealthiest, best fed, best housed, healthiest, most self-reliant older population in our history. “This statement is small comfort to those living below the poverty line, but it does explode some of the old traditional beliefs and fears. Opportunities for moving in and up in a large company may shrink but many older people begin successful small businesses, volunteer in satisfying activities, and stay active for many years. They have few role models because in previous generations the life span was much shorter and expectations of life were fewer. They are ploughing new ground.
Employers are beginning to recognize that the mature person can bring a great deal of stability and responsibility to a position. One doesn’t lose ability and experience on the eve of one’s 65th or 70th birthday any more than one grows up instantly at age 21.
26.	After the age of 40, ________.
A) most workers are tired of their present jobs
B) many workers tend to stick their present jobs
C) people find their jobs more rewarding than before
D) people still wish to hunt for more suitable jobs
27.	From Heilman’s remark, we can see that ________.
A) full use has been made of the wisdom of older people
B) the wisdom of older people is not valued by American society
C) older people are no less intelligent than young people
D) the wisdom of older people is of great value to American society
28.	Tish Sommers argues that ________.
A) older women find it hard to escape poverty
B) older women usually perform better in their jobs
C) the major cause of the poverty of older women is sexism
D) more people have come to believe in sexism and ageism
29.	According to the third paragraph, it can be seen that older Americans ________.
A) have more job opportunities than young people
B) live below the poverty line
C) have new opportunities to remain active in society
D) no longer believe in the promise of a happy life upon retirement
30.	It can be concluded from the passage that the writer ________.
A) calls attention to the living conditions of older Americans
B) believes that value of older people is gaining increasing recognition
C) attempts to justify the youth-oriented, throw-away culture of the United States
D) argues people should not retire at the age of 65 or 70
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
The most exciting kind of education is also the most personal. Nothing can exceed the joy of discovering for yourself something that is important to you! It may be an idea or a bit of information you come across accidentally—or a sudden insight, fitting together pieces of information or working through a problem. Such personal encounters are the “payoff” in education. A teacher may direct you to learning and even encourage you in it—but no teacher can make the excitement or the joy happen. That’s up to you.
A research paper, assigned in a course and perhaps checked at various stages by an instructor, leads you beyond classroom, beyond the texts for classes and into a process where the joy of discovery and learning can come to you many times. Preparing the research paper is an active and individual process, and ideal learning process. It provides a structure within which you can make exciting discoveries, of knowledge and of self, that are basic to education. But the research paper also gives you a chance to individualize a school assignment, to suit a piece of work to your own interests and abilities, to show others what you can do. Writing a research paper is more than just a classroom exercise. It is an experience in searching out, understanding and synthesizing, which forms the basis of many skills applicable to both academic and nonacademic tasks. It is, in the fullest sense, a discovering, an education. So, to produce a good research paper is both a useful and a thoroughly satisfying experience!
To some, the thought of having to write an assigned number of pages, often more than ever produced before, is disconcerting. To others, the very idea of having to work independently is threatening. But there is no need to approach the research paper assignment with anxiety, and nobody should view the research paper as an obstacle to overcome. Instead, consider it a goal to accomplish, a goal within reach if you use the help this book can give you.
31.	According to the writer, personal discoveries ________.
A) will give one encouragement and direction
B) are helpful in finding the right information
C) are the most valuable part of one’s personal education
D) will help one to successfully complete school assignments
32.	It can be inferred from the passage that writing a research paper gives one chances ________.
A) to fully develop one’s personal abilities
B) to use the skills learnt in the classroom
C) to prove that one is a productive writer
D) to demonstrate how well one can accomplish school assignment
33.	From the context, the word “disconcerting” (Para. 3, Line 2) most probably means ________.
A) misleading
B) embarrassing
C) stimulating
D) upsetting
34.	The writer argues in the passage that ________.
A) one should explore new areas in research
B) one should trust one’s own ability to meet course requirements
C) one should consider research paper writing a pleasure, not a burden
D) one should use all one’s knowledge and skills when doing research
35.	What will probably follow this passage?
A) How to write a research paper.
B) The importance of research in education.
C) How to make new discoveries for oneself.
D) The skill of putting pieces of information together.
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In our culture, the sources of what we call a sense of “mastery”—feeling important and worth-while-and the sources of what we call a sense “pleasure”-finding life enjoyable-are not always identical. Women often are told “You can’t have it all.” Sometimes what the speaker really is saying is: “You chose a career, so you can’t expect to have closer relationships or a happy family life.” or “You have a wonderful husband and children—What’s all this about wanting a career?” But women need to understand and develop both aspects of well-being, if they are to feel good about themselves.
Our study shows that, for women, well-being has two dimensions. One is mastery, which includes self-esteem (自尊), a sense of control over your life, and low levels of anxiety and depression. Mastery is closely related to the “doing” side of life, to work and activity. Pleasure is the other dimensions, and it is composed of happiness, satisfaction and optimism (乐观). It is tied more closely to the “feeling” side of life. The two are independent of each other. A woman could be high in mastery and low in pleasure, and vice versa. For example, a woman who has a good job, but whose mother has just died, might be feeling very good about herself and in control of her work life, but the pleasure side could be damaged for a time.
The concepts of mastery and pleasure can help us identify the sources of well-being for women, and remedy past mistakes. In the past, women were encouraged to look only at the feeling side of life as the source of all well-being. But we know that both mastery and pleasure are critical. And mastery seems to be achieved largely through work. In our study, all the groups of employed women rated significantly higher in mastery than did women who were not employed.
A woman’s well-being is enhanced (增进) when she takes on multiple roles. At least by middle adulthood, the women who were involved in a combination of roles-marriages, motherhood, and employment were the highest in well-being, despite warnings about stress and strain.
36.	It can be inferred from the first paragraph that ________.
A) for women, a sense of “mastery” is more important than a sense of “pleasure”
B) for women, a sense of “pleasure” is more important than a sense of “mastery”
C) women can’t have a sense of “mastery” and a sense of “pleasure” at the same time
D) a sense of “mastery” and a sense of “pleasure” are both indispensable to women
37.	The author’s attitude towards women having a career is ________.
A) critical
B) positive
C) neutral
D) realistic
38.	One can conclude from the passage that if a woman takes on several social roles, ________.
A) it will be easier for her to overcome stress and strain
B) she will be more successful in her career
C) her chances of getting promoted will be greater
D) her life will be richer and more meaningful
39.	Which of the following can be identified as a source of “pleasure” for women?
A) Family life
B) Regular employment
C) Multiple roles in society
D) Freedom from anxiety
40.	The most appropriate title for the passage would be ________.
A) The well-being of Career Women
B) Sources of Mastery and Pleasure
C) Two Aspects of Women’s Well-Being
D) Freedom Roles Women in Society

When we consider the comfortable circumstances of a working family today, the life of the working man in 1882 seems miserable indeed. But earlier it had been even hard. At the beginning of the (71) nineteenth century working hours were from sunrise to sunset, pay was awful, and working conditions being poor and dangerous. (72)
The working man had little schooling beyond his craft, and there was little hope that their children would have (73) nothing better. There were no public schools, and besides, the few (74) pennies which the children could earn needed to help support the (75) family, if he was present because of sickness, there was often no (76) job from him when he returned. Since there were always plenty of (77) other workers to take his job, he was likely to be hired if he asked (78) for more pay.
Viewed against today’s standards, the attitude of the nineteenth-century factory owners seems incredible. They believed that was good business to hire men, women and children as cheaply (79) as possible, make them to work as they could and, when (80) they became inefficient, worn out, or unable to work for any reason, discharge them.

The time is 7 o’clock, and this is Amely Brown with the news: The German authorities are sending investigators to discover the cause of the plane crash late yesterday on the Island of Tenariff. The plane, a Boeing 727 taking German holiday makers to the island crashed into a hill side as it circled for preparing to land. The plane was carrying 180 passengers. It is thought there are no survivors. Rescue workers are at the scene.
The 500 U.K. motors workers who had bent on strike in High Town for the past 3 weeks went back to work this morning.

Passage Two
When I arrived in American three years ago, I was surprised by the tremendous amount of advertising. But now I’ve come to realize that it is a creative and necessary part of an industrial society. I, too, want to improve my life style and to buy better products. I look to advertising to show me how to do it. Deciding what to believe in an advertising, however, isn’t easy. It seems to me that a person must purchase things with a lot of care. As a consumer, I want to get the best for my money. So I really have to understand the techniques of advertising. Otherwise, manufactures may be able to sell anything, whatever its quality may be. The creative aspects of advertisement, for instance, often cover up the defects or problems in products. I have learned this well, since I have made purchases and lost money because the items were of poor quality. The future advertising most likely will involve more public participation. In the future, if consumers really care about the quality of something as well as the quantity, maybe advertisers will begin to care more about what they are trying to sell.
Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
15.	What do we learn about the speaker?
16.	What’s the speaker’s impression of the advertisement in America when he first arrived there?
17.	What does the speaker think future advertisers should do?
Passage Three
After years of study, I have determined there are only two types of people in this world: those who get to the airport early and those who walk in just as the plane is about to take off. If there were any justice in the world, the early airport people would be rewarded for doing the right thing and the late airport people would be punished. But there is no justice. I know I have been an early airport person for years. My luggage will get on the plane first but it will be the last luggage to come off the plane when we land. You know who really gets his luggage first when we land? The late airport person, who rushes into the airport three minutes before the plane takes off. “But if I get there real early,” I told myself, “I will get the best seat.” Well, no matter how early I showed up, I was always told that someone had called two or three days ahead of me and asked for that seat. The utmost embarrassment of the early airport person happened to me a few years age when I was flying from New York to Chicago. When I got to the ticket counter, the person there said, “Sir, you have a seat on the 9:15 a.m. flight, is that right?” “Yes,” I said. “Well, it’s only 7:00 a.m. and the 7:05 a.m. flight has not left yet. If you hurry you can make it.” I was too embarrassed to say that I arrived early so I wouldn’t have to hurry. Instead, I ran down the corridor to the plane.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	What does the speaker say about the early airport person?
19.	What usually happens to the late airport person?
20.	What made the speaker feel embarrassed?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
The process of perceiving other people is rarely translated (to ourselves or others) into cold, objective terms. “She was 5 feet 8 inches tall, had fair hair, and wore a colored skirt.” More often, we try to get inside the other person to pinpoint his or her attitudes, emotions, motivations, abilities, ideas and characters. Furthermore, we sometimes behave as if we can accomplish this difficult job very quickly-perhaps with a two-second glance.
We try to obtain information about others in many ways. Berger suggests several methods for reducing uncertainties about others: watching, without being noticed, a person interacting with others, particularly with others who are known to you so you can compare the observed person’s behavior with the known others’ behavior; observing a person in a situation where social behavior is relatively unrestrained or where a wide variety of behavioral responses are called for; deliberately structuring the physical or social environment so as to observe the person’s responses to specific stimuli; asking people who have had or have frequent contact with the person about him or her; and using various strategies in face-to-face interaction to uncover information about another person-questions, self-disclosures (自我表露), and so on. Getting to know someone is a never-ending task, largely because people are constantly changing and the methods we use to obtain information are often imprecise. You may have known someone for ten years and still know very little about him. If we accept the idea that we won’t ever fully know another person, it enables us to deal more easily with those things that get in the way of accurate knowledge such as secrets and deceptions. It will also keep us from being too surprised or shocked by seemingly inconsistent behavior. Ironically (讽刺性地) those things that keep us from knowing another person too well (e.g., secrets and deceptions) may be just as important to the development of satisfying relationship as those things that enable us to obtain accurate knowledge about a person (e.g., disclosure and truthful statements).
21.	The word “pinpoint” (Para. 1, Line 3) basically means ________.
A) appreciate
B) obtain
C) interpret
D) identify
22.	What do we learn from the first paragraph?
A) People are better described in cold, objective terms.
B) The difficulty of getting to know a person is usually underestimated.
C) One should not judge people by their appearances.
D) One is usually subjective when assessing other people’s personality.
23.	It can be inferred from Berger’s suggestions that ________.
A) people do not reveal their true self on every occasion
B) in most cases we should avoid contacting the observed person directly
C) the best way to know a person is by making comparisons
D) face-to-face interaction is the best strategy to uncover information about a person
24.	In developing personal relationships, secrets and deceptions, in the author’s opinion, are ________.
A) personal matters that should be seriously dealt with
B) barriers that should be done away with
C) as significant as disclosures and truthful statements
D) things people should guard against
25.	The author’s purpose in writing the passage is ________.
A) to give advice on appropriate conduct for social occasions
B) to provide ways of how to obtain information about people
C) to call the reader’s attention to the negative side of people’s characters
D) to discuss the various aspects of getting to know people
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The competition among producers of personal computers is essentially a race to get the best, most innovative products to the marketplace. Marketers in this environment frequently have to make a judgement as to their competitors’ role when making marketing strategy decisions. If major competitors are changing their products, then a marketer may want to follow suit to remain competitive. Apple Computer, Inc. has introduced two new, faster personal computers, the Mackintosh II and Mackintosh SE, in anticipation of the introduction of a new PC by IBM, one of Apple’s major competitors.
Apple’s new computers are much faster and more powerful than its earlier models. The improved Mackintosh is able to run programs that previously were impossible to run on an Apple PC, including IBM-compatible (兼容的) programs. This compatibility feature illustrates computer manufactures’ new attitude of giving customers the features they want. Making Apple computers capable of running IBM software is Apple’s effort at making the Mackintosh compatible with IBM computers and thus more popular in the office, where Apple hopes to increase sales. Users of the new Apple can also add accessories (附件) to make their machines specialize in specific uses, such as engineering and writing.
The new computers represent a big improvement over past models, but they also cost much more. Company officials do not think the higher price will slow down buyers who want to step up to a more powerful computer. Apple wants to stay in the high-price end of the personal computer market to finance research for even faster, more sophisticated computers.
Even though Apple and IBM are major competitors, both companies realize that their competitor’s computers have certain features that their own models do not. The Apple line has always been popular for its sophisticated color graphics (图形), whereas the IBM machines have always been favored in offices. In the future, there will probably be more compatibility between the two companies’ products, which no doubt will require that both Apple and IBM change marketing strategies.
26.	According to the passage, Apple Computer, Inc, has introduced the Mackintosh II and the Mackintosh SE because ________.
A) IBM is changing its computer models continuously
B) it wants to make its machines specialize in specific uses
C) it wants to stay ahead of IBM in the competitive computer market
D) it expects its major competitor IBM to follow its example
27.	Apple hopes to increase Mackintosh sales chiefly by ________.
A) making its new models capable of running IBM software
B) improving the color graphics of its new models
C) copying the marketing strategies of IBM
D) giving the customers what they want
28.	Apple sells its new computer models at a high price because ________.
A) they have new features and functions
B) they are more sophisticated than other models
C) they have new accessories attached
D) it wants to accumulate funds for future research
29.	It can be inferred from the passage that both Apple and IBM try to gain a competitive advantage by ________.
A) copying each other’s technology
B) incorporating features that make their products distinctive
C) making their computer more expensive
D) making their computers run much faster
30.	The best title for the passage would be ________.
A) Apple’s Efforts to Stay Ahead of IBM
B) Apple’s New Computer Technology
C) Apple’s New personal Computers
D) Apple’s Research Activities
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
It is a curious paradox that we think of the physical sciences as “hard”, the social sciences as “soft”, and the biological sciences as somewhere in between. This is interpreted to mean that our knowledge of physical systems is more certain than our knowledge of biological systems, and these in turn are more certain than our knowledge of social systems. In terms of our capacity to sample the relevant universes, however, and the probability that our images of these universes are at least approximately correct, one suspects that a reverse order is more reasonable. We are able to sample earth’s social systems with some degree of confidence that we have a reasonable sample of the total universe being investigated. Our knowledge of social systems, therefore, while it is in many ways extremely inaccurate, is not likely to be seriously overturned by new discoveries. Even the folk knowledge in social systems on which ordinary life is based in earning, spending, organizing, marrying, taking part in political activities, fighting and so on, is not very dissimilar from the more sophisticated images of the social system derived from the social sciences, even though it is built upon the very imperfect samples of personal experience.
In contrast, our image of the astronomical universe, of even of earth’s geological history, can easily be subject to revolutionary changes as new data comes in and new theories are worked out. If we define the “security” our image of various parts of the total system as the probability of their suffering significant changes, then we would reverse the order of hardness and see the social sciences as the most secure, the physical sciences as the least secure, and again the biological sciences as somewhere in between. Our image of the astronomical universe is the least secure of all simply because we observe such a fantastically small sample of it and its record-keeping is trivial as compared with the rich records of the social systems, or even the limited records of biological systems. Records of the astronomical universe, despite the fact that we see distant things as they were long ago, are limited in the extreme.
Even in regard to such a close neighbour as the moon, which we have actually visited, theories about its origin and history are extremely different, contradictory, and hard to choose among. Our knowledge of physical evolution is incomplete and highly insecure.
31.	The word “paradox” (Para. 1, Line 1) means “________”.
A) implication
B) contradiction
C) interpretation
D) confusion
32.	According to the author, we should reverse our classification of the physical sciences as “hard” and the social sciences as “soft” because ________.
A) a reverse ordering will help promote the development of the physical sciences
B) our knowledge of physical systems is more reliable than that of social systems
C) our understanding of the social systems is approximately correct
D) we are better able to investigate social phenomena than physical phenomena
33.	The author believes that our knowledge of social systems is more secure than that of physical systems because ________.
A) it is not based on personal experience
B) new discoveries are less likely to occur in social sciences
C) it is based on a fairly representative quantity of data
D) the records of social systems are more reliable
34.	The chances of the physical sciences being subject to great changes are the biggest because ________.
A) contradictory theories keep emerging all the time
B) new information is constantly coming in
C) the direction of their development is difficult to predict
D) our knowledge of the physical world is inaccurate
35.	We know less about the astronomical universe than we do about any social system because ________.
A) theories of its origin and history are varied
B) our knowledge of it is highly insecure
C) only a very small sample of it has been observed
D) few scientists are involved in the study of astronomy
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following.
In the early days of nuclear power, the United States made money on it. But today opponents have so complicated its development that no nuclear plants have been ordered or built here in 12 years.
The greatest fear of nuclear power opponents has always been a reactor “meltdown” (堆内熔化). Today, the chances of a meltdown that would threaten U.S. public health are very little. But to even further reduce the possibility, engineers are testing new reactors that rely not on human judgement to shut them down but on the laws of nature. Now General Electric is already building two advanced reactors in Japan. But don’t expect them ever on U.S. shores unless things change in Washington.
The procedure for licensing nuclear power plants is a bad dream. Any time during, or even after, construction, an objection by any group or individual can bring everything to a halt while the matter is investigated or taken to court. Meanwhile, the builder must add nice-but-not-necessary improvements, some of which force him to knock down walls and start over. In every case where a plant has been opposed, the Nuclear Regulation Commission has ultimately granted a license to construct or operate. But the victory often costs so much that the utility ends up abandoning the plant anyway.
A case in point is the Shoreham plant on New York’s Long Island. Shoreham was a virtual twin to the Millstone plant in Connecticut, both ordered in the mid-’60s. Millstone, completed for $101 million, has been generating electricity for two decades. Shoreham, however, was singled out by anti-nuclear activists who, by sending in endless protests, drove the cost over $5 billion and delayed its use for many years.
Shoreham finally won its operation license. But the plant has never produced a watt of power. Governor Mario Cuomo, an opponent of a Shoreham start-up, used his power to force New York’s public-utilities commission to accept the following settlement; the power company could pass the cost of Shoreham along to its consumers only if it agreed not to operate the plant! Today, a perfectly good facility, capable of servicing hundreds of homes, sits rusting.
36.	What has made the procedure for licensing nuclear power plants a bad dream?
A) The inefficiency of the Nuclear Regulation commission.
B) The enormous cost of construction and operation.
C) The length of time it takes to make investigations.
D) The objection of the opponents of nuclear power.
37.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that ________.
A) it is not technical difficulties that prevent the building of nuclear power plants in the U.S.
B) there are not enough safety measures in the U.S. for running new nuclear power plants
C) there are already more nuclear power plants than necessary in the U.S.
D) the American government will not allow Japanese nuclear reactors to be installed in the U.S.
38.	Any objection, however trivial it may be, can ________.
A) force the power companies to cancel the project
B) delay the construction or operation of a nuclear plant
C) cause a serious debate within the Nuclear Regulation Commission
D) take the builders to court
39.	Governor Mario’s chief intention in proposing the settlement was to ________.
A) stop the Shoreham plant from going into operation
B) help the power company to solve its financial problems
C) urge the power company to further increase its power supply
D) permit the Shoreham plant to operate under certain conditions
40.	The author’s attitude towards the development of nuclear power is ________.

B) neutral
C) positive
D) questioning

Part IV Error Correction (15 minutes)
Directions:	This part consists of a short passage. In this passage, there are altogether 10 mistakes, one in each numbered line. You may have to change a word, add a word or delete a word. Mark out the mistakes and put the corrections in the blanks provided. If you change a word, cross it out and write the correct word in the corresponding blank. If you add a word, put an insertion mark (∧) in the right place and write the missing word in the blank. If you delete a word, cross it and put a slash (/) in the blank.
Example:
Television is rapidly becoming the literature of our periods╱.	1. time/times/period Many of the arguments having╱ used for the study of literature as	2. _______\_______ a school subject are valid for ∧ study of television.	3. ______the______
We are all naturally attracted to people with ideas, beliefs and interests like our own. Similarly, we feel comfortable with people with physical qualities similar as ours. (71)
You may have noticed about how people who live or work (72) closely together come to behave in a similar way. Unconsciously we copy these we are close to or love or admire. So a sportsman’s (73) individual way of walking with raised shoulders is imitated by an admired (74) fan; a pair of lovers both shake their heads in the same way; an employer finds himself duplicating his boss’s habit of wagging (摆动) (75) a pen between his fingers while thinking.
In every case, the influential person may consciously notice the (76) imitation but he will feel comfortably in its presence. And if he does (77) notice the matching of his gestures or movements, he finds it pleasing he is influencing people; they are drawn to them. (78)
Sensitive people have been mirroring their friend and acquaintances (79) all their lives, and winning affection and respect in this way without aware of their methods. Now, for people who want to win (80) agreement or trust, affection or sympathy, some psychologists recommend the deliberate use of physical imitation.

Section B
Passage One
In the United States, many people once lived in large, two and story homes. Today, many people would like to live in such houses but most people can’t. They don’t have enough money to buy them or even to make the first payment. So, many people rent from month to month. But some Americans really want to live in a house of their own. So they build their own home. They buy a house that is situated in an area where house are cheaper. It is better to reside in a bad part of town, they think, than not to live in a house at all. Or they buy an old house and redesign it. Then they decorate it with old style furniture. Sometimes they can male an old house look more beautiful than a new one. Usually, it is not difficult for people to find an old home to buy. Many older people decide that they don’t need a big home after their children leave. So they sell their house and move into a comfortable apartment. But when people move into a house, they sometimes have problems. Home owners have to do their own maintenance. For example. If the roof leaks, one can not ask the landlord to fix it. On the other hand, people can redesign their homes in any way they want without having to be afraid of being thrown out by the landlord.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	Why don’t many Americans live in large two and three story houses?
12.	Why is it easy to find old houses for sale?
13.	What problem will people have after they buy a house?
Passage Two
Lions prefer to eat without having to do much work. When resting in the shade, they! Are also watching the sky. And if they see birds fly down, they immediately sense that something must be happening. Even in the heat of the day. They will certainly arise and run a mile across the plains to find out what is going on. If another animal has made a kill, they will drive it off and take the dead animal for themselves. A grown lion can easily consume 60 pounds of meat at a single feeding. Often, they eat until it seems painful for them to lie down. The female lions are leaner and swifter, and as a result, are better hunters than the males. Most kills are made at night or just before dawn. The kill is the most exciting moment in the day-to-day existence of the lions, since these great beasts spend most of their time-about 20 hours a day-sleeping and resting. Lions are also social cats. And during these times of leisure, they love to romp against each other, and the young lions are always playing among themselves and with their parents.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What do we learn about lions from what we have just heard?
15.	Why do the lions watch the birds in the sky?
16.	Why are the females generally better hunters than the males?
Passage Three
To be successful in a job interview, you should demonstrate certain personal and professional qualities. You need to create a good image in the limited time available, usually from 30 to 45 minutes. You must make a positive impression which the interviewer will remember while he interviews other candidates. The following are some qualities you should especially pay attention to during an interview. First of all, you should take care to appear to be properly dressed. The right clothes worn at the right time can win respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement. It may not be true that clothes you wear. Secondly, you should pay close attention to your manner of speaking, since speech is a reflection of personality. You should reflect confidence by speaking in a clear voice, loud enough to be heard, without being aggressive or overpowering. You should be prepared to talk knowledgeably about the requirements of the position you are applying for. Finally, to be really impressive you must convey a sense of self-confidence and enthusiasm for work. If you display these characteristics, with just a little luck, you’ll certainly succeed in the typical personnel interview.
Questions 17 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
17.	How long does an interview usually last according to the speaker?
18.	How can one give the interviewer a good first impression?
19.	What should be the best manner of speaking for a job-seeker during an interview?
20.	What is the main idea of the short talk you have just heard?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
A new era is upon us. Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society. It all translates to a fundamental change in the way we work. Already we’re partly there. The percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World. Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan (two thirds or more in many of these countries) are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise. More women are in the work force than ever before. There are more part-time jobs. More people are self-employed. But the breadth of the economic transformation can’t be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to a radical new way of thinking about the nature of work itself. Long-held notions about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers—all these are being challenged.
We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead. No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip (集成块), would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots. Tomorrow’s achievements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence or even some still unimagined technology could produce a similar wave of dramatic changes. But one thing is certain: information and knowledge will become even more vital, and the people who possess it, whether they work in manufacturing or services, will have the advantage and produce the wealth. Computer knowledge will become as basic a requirement as the ability to read and write. The ability to solve problems by applying information instead of performing routine tasks will be valued above all else. If you cast your mind ahead 10 years, information services will be predominant. It will be the way you do your job.
21.	A characteristic of the information age is that ________.
A) the service industry is relying more and more on the female work force
B) manufacturing industries are steadily increasing
C) people find it harder and harder to earn a living by working in factories
D) most of the job opportunities can now be found in the service industry
22.	One of the great changes brought about by the knowledge society is that ________.
A) the difference between the employee and the employer has become insignificant
B) people’s traditional concepts about work no longer hold true
C) most people have to take part-time jobs
D) people have to change their jobs from time to time
23.	By referring to computers and other inventions, the author means to say that ________.
A) people should be able to respond quickly to the advancement of technology
B) future achievements in technology will bring about inconceivable dramatic changes
C) the importance of high technology has been overlooked
D) computer science will play a leading role in the future information services
24.	The future will probably belong to those who ________.
A) possess and know how to make use of information
B) give full play to their brain potential
C) involve themselves in service industries
D) cast their minds ahead instead of looking back
25.	Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
A) Computers and the Knowledge Society
B) Service Industries in Modern Society
C) Features and Implications of the New Era
D) Rapid Advancement of Information Technology
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Beauty has always been regarded as something praiseworthy. Almost everyone thinks attractive people are happier and healthier, have better marriages and have more respectable occupations. Personal consultants give them better advice for finding jobs. Even judges are softer on attractive defendants (被告). But in the executive circle, beauty can become a liability.
While attractiveness is a positive factor for a man on his way up the executive ladder, it is harmful to a woman.
Handsome male executives were perceived as having more integrity than plainer men; effort and ability were thought to account for their success.
Attractive female executives were considered to have less integrity than unattractive ones; their success was attributed not to ability but to factors such as luck.
All unattractive women executives were thought to have more integrity and to be more capable than the attractive female executives. Interestingly, though, the rise of the unattractive overnight successes was attributed more to personal relationships and less to ability than was that of attractive overnight successes.
Why are attractive women not thought to be able? An attractive woman is perceived to be more feminine (女性的) and an attractive man more masculine (男性的) than the less attractive ones. Thus, an attractive woman has an advantage in traditionally female jobs, but an attractive woman in a traditionally masculine position appears to lack the “masculine” qualities required.
This is true even in politics. “When the only clue is how he or she looks, people treat men and women differently,” says Ann Bowman, who recently published a study on the effects of attractiveness on political candidates. She asked 125 undergraduates to rank two groups of photographs, one of men and one of women, in order of attractiveness. The students were told the photographs were of candidates for political offices. They were asked to rank them again, in the order they would vote for them.
The results showed that attractive males utterly defeated unattractive men, but the women who had been ranked most attractive invariably received the fewest votes.
26.	The word “liability” (Para. 1. Line 4) most probably means “________”.
A) misfortune
B) instability
C) disadvantage
D) burden
27.	In traditionally female jobs, attractiveness ________.
A) reinforces the feminine qualities required
B) makes women look more honest and capable
C) is of primary importance to women
D) often enables women to succeed quickly
28.	Bowman’s experiment reveals that when it comes to politics, attractiveness ________.
A) turns out to be an obstacle
B) affects men and women alike
C) has as little effect on men as on women
D) is more of an obstacle than a benefit to women
29.	It can be inferred from the passage that people’s views on beauty are often ________.
A) practical
B) prejudiced
C) old-fashioned
D) radical
30.	The author writes this passage to ________.
A) discuss the negative aspects of being attractive
B) give advice to job-seekers who are attractive
C) demand equal rights for women
D) emphasize the importance of appearance
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
The importance and focus of the interview in the work of the print and broadcast journalist is reflected in several books that have been written on the topic. Most of these books, as well as several chapters, mainly in, but not limited to, journalism and broadcasting handbooks and reporting texts, stress the “how to” aspects of journalistic interviewing rather than the conceptual aspects of the interview, its context, and implications. Much of the “how to” material is based on personal experiences and general impressions. As we know, in journalism as in other fields, much can be learned from the systematic study of professional practice. Such study brings together evidence from which broad generalized principles can be developed.
There is, as has been suggested, a growing body of research literature in journalism and broadcasting, but very little significant attention has been devoted to the study of the interview itself. On the other hand, many general texts as well as numerous research articles on interviewing in fields other than journalism have been written. Many of these books and articles present the theoretical and empirical (经验的) aspects of the interview as well as the training of the interviewers. Unhappily, this plentiful general literature about interviewing pays little attention to the journalistic interview. The fact that the general literature on interviewing does not deal with the journalistic interview seems to be surprising for two reasons. First, it seems likely that most people in modern Western societies are more familiar, at least in a positive manner, with journalistic interviewing than with any other form of interviewing. Most of us are probably somewhat familiar with the clinical interview, such as that conducted by physicians and psychologists. In these situations the professional person or interviewer is interested in getting information necessary for the diagnosis (诊断) and treatment of the person seeking help. Another familiar situation is the job interview. However, very few of us have actually been interviewed personally by the mass media, particularly by television. And yet, we have a vivid acquaintance with the journalistic interview by virtue of our roles as readers, listeners, and viewers. Even so, true understanding of the journalistic interview, especially television interviews, requires thoughtful analyses and even study, as this book indicates.
31.	The main idea of the first paragraph is that ________.
A) generalized principles for journalistic interviews are the chief concern for writers on journalism
B) importance should be attached to the systematic study of journalistic interviewing
C) concepts and contextual implications are of secondary importance to journalistic interviewing
D) personal experience and general impression should be excluded from journalistic interviews
32.	Much research has been done on interviews in general ________.
A) so the training of journalistic interviewers has likewise been strengthened
B) though the study of the interviewing techniques hasn’t received much attention
C) but journalistic interviewing as a specific field has unfortunately been neglected
D) and there has also been a dramatic growth in the study of journalistic interviewing
33.	Westerners are familiar with the journalistic interview, ________.
A) but most of them wish to stay away from it
B) and many of them hope to be interviewed some day
C) and many of them would like to acquire a true understanding of it
D) but most of them may not have been interviewed in person
34.	Who is the interviewee in a clinical interview?
A) The patient.
B) The physician.
C) The journalist.
D) The psychologist.
35.	The text is most likely a part of a ________.
A) news article
B) journalistic interview
C) research report
D) preface
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
The relationship between the home and market economies has gone through two distinct stages. Early industrialization began the process of transferring some production processes (e.g. clothmaking, sewing and canning foods) from the home to the marketplace. Although the home economy could still produce these goods, the processes were laborious (费力的) and the market economy was usually more efficient. Soon, the more important second stage was evident-the marketplace began producing goods and services that had never been produced by the home economy, and the home economy was unable to produce them (e.g. Electricity and electrical appliances, the automobile, advanced education, sophisticated medical care). In the second stage, the question of whether the home economy was less efficient in producing these new goods and services was irrelevant; if the family were to enjoy these fruits of industrialization, they would have to be obtained in the marketplace. The traditional ways of taking care of these needs in the home, such as in nursing the sick, became socially unacceptable (and, in most serious cases, probably less successful).
Just as the appearance of the automobile made the use of the horse-drawn carriage illegal and then impractical, and the appearance of television changed the radio from a source of entertainment to a source of background music, so most of the fruits of economic growth did not increase the options available to the home economy to either produce the goods or services or purchase them in the market. Growth brought with it increased variety in consumer goods, but not increased flexibility for the home economy in obtaining these goods and services. Instead, economic growth brought with it increased consumer reliance on the marketplace. In order to consume these new goods and services, the family had to enter the marketplace as wage earners and consumers. The neoclassical (新古典主义的) model that views the family as deciding whether to produce goods and services directly or to purchase them in the marketplace is basically a model of the first stage. It cannot accurately be applied to the second (and current) stage.
36.	The reason why many production processes were taken over by the marketplace was that ________.
A) it was a necessary step in the process of industrialization
B) they depended on electricity available only to the market economy
C) it was troublesome to produce such goods in the home
D) the marketplace was more efficient with respect to these processes
37.	It can be seen from the passage that in the second stage ________.
A) some traditional goods and services were not successful when provided by the home economy
B) the market economy provided new goods and services never produced by the home economy
C) producing traditional goods at home became socially unacceptable
D) whether new goods and services were produced by the home economy became irrelevant
38.	During the second stage, if the family wanted to consume new goods and services, they had to enter the marketplace ________.
A) as wage earners
B) both as manufactures and consumers
C) both as workers and purchasers
D) as customers
39.	Economic growth did not make it more flexible for the home economy to obtain the new goods and services because ________.
A) the family was not efficient in production
B) it was illegal for the home economy to produce them
C) it could not supply them by itself
D) the market for these goods and services was limited
40.	The neoclassical model is basically a model of the first stage, because at this stage ________.
A) the family could rely either on the home economy or on the marketplace for the needed goods and services
B) many production processes were being transferred to the marketplace
C) consumers relied more and more on the market economy
D) the family could decide how to transfer production processes to the marketplace

Section B
Passage One
In the early days of railroads horses pulled the trains. The trains had no engines and no power of their own. Richard Traversic of England invented a steam powered engine in 1840. Soon people were building railroads and steam engines all over the world. Because the steam engine did the work that animals used to do, people called them “Iron Horses”. Peter Copper was a rich American businessman. He owned a lot of land near the Bottomhal and Ohio railroad. He wanted the railroad to be successful. He built his own steam engine to drive along the railroad. Most people traveled in coaches drawn by houses. A coach line challenged Peter Copper to a race.
The day of the race came. At first, the horse was winning the race. Peter Copper’s engine needed time to build up steam. He worked hard to make the train go faster. Soon, he was catching up with the horse. He was going to win the race. Suddenly, one of the parts of the engine broke. The train stopped. The horse rushed ahead. Peter Copper lost the race. Of course, that is not the end of the story. By 1870, railroads extended all across the United States. The Iron Horse had become an important part of American life.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	Why did people call steam engines Iron Horses?
12.	Why did Peter Copper build his own steam engine?
13.	Why did Peter Copper lose the race?
Passage Two
Hollywood produces many different kinds of films, including mysteries, musicals, love stories and horror films. Different these films may be. They generally have one thing in common conflict. The main character wants something very badly and will do anything to get it. The opponent tries to stop the main character from achieving his goal. This opposition creates conflict and conflict is the heart of drama. To give an example. Let’s say the main character is a young man of humble origin, who wants to marry the beautiful daughter of a rich banker. The father thinks the young man is unworthy of his daughter and he does not allow her to see him. The young man, who is very much in love, refuses to give up without a fight. The conflict between the young man and the girl’s father is what makes the story interesting. It forces the main characters to take action and through their action we see them as they really are. In the good story, the main character changes. He is not the same at the end of the story as he was at the beginning. He learns something from watching her. Good movies not only entertain us, they also help us understand a little more about life.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What is common to all the films produced in Hollywood?
15.	What usually happens to the main character in a good story?
16.	What can we learn from good movies?
Passage Three
In a way, all of us are on a spaceship-the planet Earth. We move around the sun at 18 miles per second and never stop. On our spaceship, we have 5 billion people and limited supply of air, water an land. These supplies have to be used carefully because we can’t buy new air, water or land from anywhere else. Environment on our planet is a closed system. Nothing new is ever added. Nature recycles its resources. Water, for example, evaporates and rises as visible drops to form clouds. The same water returns to the earth as rain or snow. The rain that falls today is actually the same water that fell on the land 70 million years ago. Today, the earth is in trouble. Factories pour dirty water into our rivers, many fish and water becomes unhealthy for people to get sick. People throw bottles and paper out of their car windows and roadside becomes covered with all sorts of wastes. Over the years people have changed environment and we have pollution. To continue to survive, we must learn how to use the earth resources wisely. We have to change out habits and stop dropping such enormous amounts of industrial waste into the water and air. We must cooperate with nature and learn better ways to use, not abuse our environment.
Questions 17 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
17.	Why does the speaker compare the earth to a spaceship?
18.	How fast does the planet Earth travel around the sun?
19.	Why does the speaker advise us to use the earth resources wisely?
20.	What message is the speaker trying to convey?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is following by some questions or unfinished statements-For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:
Material culture refers to the touchable, material “things”—physical objects that can be seen, held, felt, used—that a culture produces. Examining a culture’s tools and technology can tell us about the group’s history and way of life. Similarly, research into the material culture of music can help us to understand the music-culture. The most vivid body of “things” in it, of course, are musical instruments. We cannot hear for ourselves the actual sound of any musical performance before the 1870s when the phonograph was invented, so we rely on instruments for important information about music-cultures it the remote past and their development. Here we have two kinds of evidence: instruments well preserved and instruments pictures in art. Through the study of instruments, as well preserved Paintings, written documents, and so on, we can explore the movement of music from the Neat East to China over a thousand years ago, or we can outline the spread of Near eastern influence to Europe that results in the development of most of the instruments on the symphony orchestra.
Sheet music or printed music, too is material culture. Scholars once defined folk music-cultures as those in with people learn and sing music by ear rather than from print, but research show mutual influence among oral and written sources during the past few centuries in Europe, Britain, and America, printed versions limit variety because they tend to standardize any song, yet they stimulate people to create new and different songs. Besides, the ability to read music notation has a far-reaching effect on musicians and, when it becomes widespread, on the music-culture as a whole.
One more important part of music’s material culture should be singled out the influence of the electronic media-radio, record player, tape recorder, television, and videocassette, with the future promising talking and singing computers and other developments. This all part of the “information revolution,” a twentieth century phenomenon as important as the industrial revolution was in the nineteenth. These electronic media are not just limited to modem nations; they have affected music-cultures all over the globe.
21.	Research into the material culture of a nation’s of great importance ________.
A) it helps produce new cultural tools and technology
B) it can reflect the development of the nation
C) it helps understand the nation’s Fast and present
D) it can demonstrate the nation’s civilization
22.	It can be learned from this passage that ________.
A) the existence of the symphony was attributed to the spread of Near Eastern and Chinese music
B) Near Eastern music had influence on the of the instruments in the symphony orchestra
C) the development of the symphony shows the mutual influence of Eastern and Western music
D) the musical instruments in the symphony basis of Near Eastern music
23.	According to the author, music notation is important because ________.
A) it has a great effect on the music-culture as more and more people are able to read it
B) it tends to standard folk sings when it is used by folk musicians
C) it is the printed version of standardized folk music
D) it encourages people to popularize printed versions of songs
24.	It can be concluded from the passage that the introduction of electronic media into the world of music ________.
A) has brought about an information revolution
B) has speeded up the arrival of a new generation of computers
C) has given rise to new forms of music culture
D) has given to the transformation of traditional musical instruments
25.	Which of the following best summarized the main idea of the passage?

B) Music cannot be passed on to future generation unless it is recorded.
C) Folk songs cannot spread far unless they are printed on music sheets.
D) The development of music culture is highly dependent or its material aspect.
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The question of whether war is inevitable is one which has concerned many of the world’s great writers. Before considering this question, it will useful to introduce some related concepts. Conflict, defined as opposition among social entities directed against one another is distinguished from competition, defined as opposition among social entities independently striving for some thing which is in inadequate supply. Competitors may not be aware of one another, while the parties to a conflict are. Conflict and vice of one another.
Opposition is thus contrasted with cooperation, the process by which social entities function in the service of one another. These definitions are necessary because it is important to emphasize that competition between individuals or groups is inevitable in a world of limited resources, but conflict is not. Conflict, nevertheless, is very likely to occur, and is probably an essential and desirable element of human societies.
Many authors have argued for the inevitability of war from the premise that in the struggle for existence among animal species, only the fittest survive. In general, however this struggle in nature’s competition, not conflict. Social animals, such as monkeys and cattle, fight to win or maintain leadership of the group. The struggle for existence occurs not in such fights but in the competition for limited feeding areas and for the occupancy of areas free from meet-eating animals. Those who fail in competition starve to death or become victims to other species. This struggle for existence does not resemble human war, but rather the competition of individuals for jobs, markets, and materials. The essence of the struggle is the competition for the necessities of life that are insufficient to satisfy all.
Among nations there is competition in developing resources trades, skills, and a satisfactory way of life. The successful nations grow and prosper; the unsuccessful decline. While it is true that this competition may induce efforts to expand territory at the expense of others, and thus lead to conflict, it cannot be said that war-like conflict among nations is inevitable, although competition is.
26.	In the first paragraph, the author gives the definitions of some term in order to ________.
A) argue for the similarities between and human societies
B) smooth out the conflicts in human societies
C) distinguish between two kinds of opposition
D) summarize the that characteristic features of opposition and cooperation
27.	According to the author, competition differs from conflict in that ________.
A) it results in war in most cases
B) it induces efforts to expand territory
C) it is kind of opposition among aria entities
D) it is essentially a struggle for existence
28.	The phrase “function in the disservice of one another” (Para. 1) most probably means “________”.
A) betray each other
B) harm one another
C) help to collaborate with each other
D) benefit on another
29.	The author indicates in the passage that conflict ________.
A) is an inevitable struggle resulting from competition
B) reflects the struggle among social animals
C) is an opposition among individual social animals
D) can be avoided
30.	The passage is probably intended to answer the question “________”.
A) Is war inevitable?
B) Why is there conflict and competition?
C) Is conflict desirable?
D) Can competition lead to conflict?
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
As Dr. Samuel Johnson said in a different era about ladies preaching, the surprising thing about computer is not that they think less well than a man, but that they think at all. The early electronic computer did not have much going for it except a marvelous memory and some good math skills. But today the best models can be wired up to learn by experience, follow an argument, ask proper questions and write poetry and write poetry and music. They can also carry on somewhat puzzling conversations.
Computers imitate life. As computer get more complex, the imitation gets better. Finally, the line between the original and the copy becomes unclear. In another 15 years or so, we will the computer as a new form of life.
The opinion seems ridiculous because, for one thing, computers lack the drives and emotions of living creatures. But drives car can be programmed into the computer’s brain just as nature programmed them into our human brains as a part of the equipment for survival.
Computers match people in some roles, and when fast decisions are needed in a crisis, they often surpass them. Having evolved when the pace of life was slower, the human brain has an inherent defect that prevents it from absorbing several streams of information simultaneously and acting on them quickly. Throw too many things at the brain one time and it freezes up.
We are still control, but the capabilities of computer are increasing at a fantastic rate, while raw human intelligence is changing slowly, if as all. Computer power has increased ten times every eight years since 1946. In the 1990s, when the sixth generation appears, the reasoning power of an intelligence built out of silicon will begin to match that of the human brain.
That does not mean the evolution of intelligence has ended on the earth. Judging by the he past, we can expect that a new species will arise out of man, surpassing his achievements those of his predecessor. Only a carbon chemistry enthusiast would assume that the new species must be man’s flesh-and-blood descendants. The new kind of intelligent life is more I likely to be made of silicon.
31.	What do you suppose the attitude of Dr. Samuel Johnson towards ladies preaching?
A) He believed that ladies were born worse preachers that men.
B) He was pleased that ladies could though not as well as men.
C) He disapproved of ladies preaching.
D) He encouraged ladies to preach.
32.	Today, computer are still inferior to man in terms of ________.
A) decision making
B) drives and feelings
C) growth of reasoning power
D) information absorption
33.	In terms of making quick decisions, the human brain cannot be compared with the computer because ________.
A) in the long process of evolution slow pace of life didn’t require such ability of the computer because brain
B) the human brain is influenced by other factors such as motivation and emotion
C) the human brain may sometimes freeze up in a dangerous situation
D) the evolution of imitate life while the human brain docs not imitate computers
34.	Though he think highly of the development of computer science, the author doesn’t mean that ________.
A) computers are likely to become a new form of intelligent life
B) human beings have lost control of computers
C) the intelligence of computers will eventually surpass will that of human beings
D) the evolution of intelligence will probably depend on that of electronic brains
35.	According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?
A) Future man will be made of silicon instead of flesh and blood.
B) Some day it will be difficult to tell a computer from a man.
C) The reasoning power of computers has already surpassed that of man.
D) Future intelligent life may not necessarily be made of organic matter.
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Video recorders and photocopiers, even ticket machines on the railways, often seem unnecessarily difficult to use. Last December I bought myself a Video cassette recorder (VCR) described as “simple to use”. In the first three weeks I failed repeatedly to program the machine to record from the TV, and after months of practice I still made mistakes. I am not alone. According to a survey last year by Ferguson, the British manufacturer, more than one in four VCR owners never use the timer on their machines to record a programme: they don’t use it because they’ve found it far too hard to operate.
So why do manufacturers keep on designing and producing VCRS that are awkward to use if the problems are so obvious?
First, the problems we notice are not obvious to technically minded designers with years of experience and trained to understand how appliances work. Secondly, designers tend to add one or two features at a time to each model, whereas you or I face all a machine’s features at once. Thirdly, although find problems in a finished product is easily, it is too late by then to do anything about the design. Finally, if manufacturers can get away with selling products that are difficult to use it, it is not worth the effort of any one of them to make improvements.
Some manufacturers say they concentrate on providing a wide range of features rather than on making the machines easy to use. But that gives rise to the question, “why can’t you have features that are easy to use?” The answer is you can.
Good design practice is a mixture of specific procedures and general principles. For a start, designers should build an original model of the machine and try it out on typical members of the public-not on colleagues in the development laboratory. Simple pubic trials would quickly reveal many design mistakes. In an ideal world, there would be some ways of controlling quality such as that the VCR must be redesigned repeatedly until, say, 90 percent of users can work 90 per cent of the features correctly 90 per cent of the time.

Most studies suggest that when women and men do the same job and have the experience, pay rates tend to be similar. Most of the dollar differences stem from fact that (71) women tend to be more recently employed and have more (72) years on the job. Whether women who have started a career will attain pay equality with men rest on at least two factors. (73)
First, will most of them continue part time at their jobs after (74) they have children? A break in their employment, or a decision (75) to work part time, will slow its raises and promotions because it would for men. Second, will male-dominated (76) companies elevate women to higher-paid jobs at the different (77) rate as they elevate men? On some fields, this had clearly not (78) happened. Many men, for example, have committed their (79) lives to teaching careers, yet relative few have become (80) principals or headmasters.

Passage One
Miss Susan Brown is 25 years old and has been a night nurse at a hospital since last April. She works 8 nights on 6 nights off from 9:15 at night to 8:00 o’clock the next morning. She worked as an office cleaner before she came to the hospital, for she hadn’t enjoyed that experience at all. It perhaps is surprising that Susan chose to work at night permanently. She felt she needed a change for one thing, and for another, she hoped to eventually to become a head nurse. She has also found that a night nurse’s work is physically less demanding that a cleaner’s, and she can sleep 8 hours during the day. Of course, there are some problems in her daily life. The most serious problem is the headache she get from the dim lighting in the hospital. She doesn’t have time to wash her long hair for 8 working days and she has to learn to pack all her social activities into 6 days out of a fortnight. But on the whole, she feels very happy.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	What job did Miss Susan Brown have before she worked as a night nurse in the hospital?
12.	Why did Susan choose to do night work?
13.	What does the passage tell us about Susan Brown?
Passage Two
Cottonville is a new prison specially designed for women criminals in Scotland. The 226 prisoners there live in small units of 7 rooms. There is a kitchen where they cook their own meals and a lounge for the fitted carpet and armchairs. The “wake up, wake up” call by loudspeakers at 7:00 every morning is followed by a music program which creates atmosphere of a holiday camp. During the day, most of the prisoners are employed in 3 workshops, making toys or clothing. Their earnings up to 90 pennies a week can be spent in the prison shop. The gymnasium, which also acts as a cinema and concert hall, has facilities for table tennis, basketball and dancing. Prisoners, particularly those of long sentences are encouraged to be independent and take responsibility for themselves and others. This is in many ways much more demanding than simply serving time. Just as the deputy governor of this prison once said “We try to preserve the prisoners’ respect as much as possible by imagining ourselves in their position.” His words explained why this new prison is run in a unique way.
Questions 14 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What’s Cottonville?
15.	What kind of people are sent to the prison mentioned in the story?
16.	What’s most important in making the prison unique?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is following by some questions or unfinished statements-For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:
Three English dictionaries published recently all lay claim to possessing a “new” feature. The BBC English Dictionary contains background information on 1,000 people and places prominent in the news since 1988; the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary: Encyclopedic Edition is the OALD plus encyclopedic entries; the Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture is the LME plus cultural information.
The key fact is that all three dictionaries can be seen to have a distinctly “cultural” as well as language learning content. That being said, the way in which they approach the cultural element is not identical, making direct comparisons between the three difficult.
While there is some common ground between the encyclopedic/cultural entries for the Oxford and Longman dictionaries, there is a clear difference. Oxford lays claim to being encyclopedic on content whereas Longman distinctly concentrates on the language and culture of the English-speaking world. The Oxford dictionary can therefore stand more vigorous scrutiny for cultural bias than the Longman publication because the latter does not hesitate about viewing the rest of the world from the cultural perspectives of the English-speaking world. The cultural objectives of the BBC dictionary are in turn more distinct still. Based on an analysis of over 70 million words recorded from the BBC World Service and National Public Radio of Washington over a period of four years, their 1,000 brief encyclopedic entries are based on people and places that have featured in the news recently. The intended user they have in mind is a regular listener to the World Service who will have a reasonable standard of English and a developed skill in listening comprehension.
In reality, though, the BBC dictionary will be purchased by a far wider range of language learners, as will the other two dictionaries. We will be faced with a situation where many of the users of these dictionaries will at the very least have distinct socio-cultural perspectives and may have world views which are totally opposed and even hostile to those of the West. Advanced learners from this kind of background will not only evaluate a dictionary on how user-friendly it is but will also have definite views about the scope and appropriateness of the various socio-cultural entries.
21.	What feature sets apart the three dictionaries discussed in the passage from traditional ones?
A) The combination of two dictionaries into one
B) The new approach to defining words
C) The inclusion of cultural content
D) The increase in the number of entries
22.	The Longman dictionary is more likely to be criticized for cultural prejudice ________.
A) its scope of cultural entries the beyond the culture of the English-speaking world
B) it pays little attention to the cultural content of the non-English-speaking countries
C) it views the world purely from the standpoint of the English-speaking world
D) it fails to distinguish language from culture in its encyclopedic entries
23.	The BBC dictionary differs from Oxford and Longman in that ________.
A) it has a wider selection Of encyclopedic entries
B) it is mainly design to meet the needs of radio listeners
C) it lays more emphasis co language then on culture
D) it is intended to help listeners develop their listening comprehension skills
24.	It is implied in the last paragraph that, in approaching socio-cultural content in a dictionary, special thought be given to ________.
A) the language levels of its users
B) the number of its prospective purchasers
C) the different tastes of its users
D) the various cultural backgrounds of its users
25.	What is the passage mainly about?
A) Different ways of treating socio-cultural elements in the three new English dictionaries.
B) A comparison of people’s opinions on the cultural content in the three new English dictionaries.
C) The advantages of the BBC dictionary over Oxford and Longman.
D) The user-friendliness of the three new English dictionaries.
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Real policemen hardly recognize any resemblance between their lives and what they see on TV.
The first difference is that a policeman’s real life revolves round criminal law. He has to know exactly what actions are crimes and what evidence can be used to prove them in court. He has to know nearly as much law as a professional lawyer, and what is more, he has to apply it on his feet, in the dark and rain, running down a street after someone he wants to talk to.
Little of his time is spent in chatting. He will spend most of his working life typing millions of words on thousands of forms about hundreds of sad, unimportant people who are guilty of stupid, petty crimes.
Most television crime drama is about finding the criminal: as soon as he’s arrested, the story is over. In real life, finding criminals is seldom much of a problem. Except in very serious cases like murders and terrorist attacks little effort is spent on searching.
Having made an arrest, a detective really start to work. He has to prove his case in court and to do that he often has to gather a lot of different evidence.
At third big difference between the drama detective and the real one is the unpleasant pressures: first, as members of a police force they always have to behave absolutely in accordance with the law. Secondly, as expensive public servants they have to get results. They can hardly ever do both. Most of the time some of them have to break the rules in small ways.
If the detective has to detective the world, the world often deceives him. Hardly anyone he meets tells him the truth. And this separation the detective feels between himself and the rest of the world is deepened by the simples mindedness as he sees it-of citizens, social workers, doctors, law-makers, and judges, who, instead of eliminating crime punish the criminals less severely in the hope that this will make them reform. The result, detectives feel, is that nine-tenths of their work is re-catching people who should have stared behind bars. This makes them rather cynical.
26.	A policeman has to be trained in criminal law because ________.
A) he must work hard to help reform criminals
B) he must believe as professional lawyers do
C) he must be able to tell when and where a crime is committed
D) he must justify the arrests he makes of criminals
27.	What is the most suitable word that describes the work of a policeman according to the passage?
A) Dangerous
B) Demanding
C) Distressing
D) Dramatic
28.	According to the passage, policemen spend most of their time an efforts ________.
A) patrolling the street, rain or shine
B) tracking and arresting criminals
C) collecting and providing evidence
D) consulting the rules of law
29.	What’s the policeman’s biggest headache?
A) He has to get the most desirable results without breaking the law in any way.
B) He has to justify his arrests while unable to provide sufficient evidence in most cases.
C) He can hardly find enough time to learn criminal law while burdened with numerous criminal cases.
D) He has to provide the best possible public service at the least possible expense.
30.	Why do policemen feel separated from the rest of the world?
A) Because they do not receive due support from society.
B) Because they find people insincere with them.
C) Because they feel superior to simple-minded people around them.
D) Because they are suspicious of the people around them.
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
To live in the United States today is to gain an appreciation for Dahrendorf’s assertion that social change exists everywhere. Technology, the application of knowledge for practical ends, is a major source of social change.
Yet we would do well to remind ourselves that technology is a human creation; it docs not exist naturally. A spear or a robot is as much a cultural as a physical object. Until humans use a spear to hunt game or a robot to produce machine parts, neither is much more than a solid mass of matter. For a bird looking for an object on which to rest, a spear or robot serves the purpose equally well. The explosion of the Challenger space shuttle and the Russian nuclear accident at Chernobyl drive home the human quality of technology; they provide cases in which well-planned systems suddenly went haywire and there was no ready hand to set them right. Since technology is a human creation, we are responsible for what is done with it. Pessimists worry that we will use out technology eventually to blow our world and ourselves to pieces. But they have been saying this for decades, and so far we have managed to survive and even flourish. Whether we will continue to do so in the years ahead remains uncertain. Clearly, the impact of technology on our lives deserves a closer examination.
Few technological developments have had a greater impact on our lives than the computer revolution. Scientists and engineers have designed specialized machines that can do the tasks that once only people could do. There are those who assert that the switch to an information-based economy is in the same camp as other great historical milestones, particularly the industrial Revolution. Yet when we ask why the industrial Revolution was a revolution, we find that it was not the machines. The primary reason why it was revolutionary is that it led to great social change. It gave rise to mass production and, through mass production, to a society in which wealth was not confined to the few.
In somewhat similar fashion, computers promise to revolutionize the structure of American life, particularly as they free the human mind and open new possibilities in knowledge and communication. The industrial Revolution supplemented and replaced the muscles of humans and animals by mechanical methods. The computer extends this development to supplement and replace some aspects of the mind of human beings by electronic methods. It is the capacity of the computer for solving problems and making decisions that represents its greatest potential and that pees the greatest difficulties in predicting the impact on society.
31.	A spear or a robot has the quality of technology only when it ________.
A) is used both as a cultural and a physical object
B) serves different purposes equally well
C) is utilized by man
D) can be of use to both man and animal
32.	The examples of the Challenger and Chernobyl cited by the author serve to show that ________.
A) if not given close examination, technology could be used to destroy our world
B) technology is a human creation, so we are responsible for it
C) technology usually goes wrong, if not controlled by man
D) being a human creation, technology is liable to error
33.	According to the author, the introduction of the computer is a revolution mainly because ________.
A) the computer has revolutionized the workings of the human mind
B) the computer can do the tasks that could only be done by people before
C) it has helped to switch to an information technology
D) it has a great potential impact on society
34.	By using the phrase “the human quality of technology”, the author refers to, the fact that technology ________.
A) has a great impact on human life
B) has some characteristics of human nature
C) can replace some aspects of the human mind
D) does not exist in the natural world
35.	The passage is based on the author’s ________.
A) keen insight into the nature of technology
B) prejudiced criticism of the role of the industrial Revolution
C) cautious analysis of the replacement of the human mind by computers
D) exaggerated description of the negative consequences of technology
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Now custom has not been commonly regarded as a subject of any great importance. The inner workings of our own brains we feel to be uniquely worthy of investigation, but custom, we have a way of thinking, is behavior at its most commonplace. As a matter of fact, it is the other way around. Traditional custom, taken the world over, is a mass of detailed behavior more astonishing than what any one person can ever evolve in individual actions. Yet that is a rather trivial aspect of the matter. The fact of first-rate importance is the predominant role that custom plays in experience and in belief and the very great varieties it may manifest.
No man ever looks at the world with pristine eyes. He sees it edited by a definite set of customs and institutions and ways of thinking. Even in his philosophical probing he cannot go behind these stereotypes; his very concepts of the true and the false will still have reference to his particular traditional customs. John Dewey has said in all seriousness that the part played by custom in shaping the behavior of the individual as over against any way in which he can affect traditional custom, is as the proportion of the total vocabulary of his mother tongue over against those words of his own baby talk that are taken up into the language of his family. When one seriously studies axial orders that have had the opportunity to develop independently, the becomes no more than an exact and matter-of-fact observation. The life history of the individual is first and foremost an adjustment to the patterns and standards traditionally handed down in his community. From the moment of his birth the customs into which he is born shape his experience and behavior. By the time he can talk, he is the little creature of his culture, and by the time he is grown and able to take part in its activities, its habits are his habits, its beliefs his beliefs, its impossibilities his impossibilities.
36.	The author thinks the reason why custom has been ignored in the academic world is that ________.
A) custom reveals only the superficial nature of human behavior
B) the study of social orders can replace the study of custom
C) people are still not aware of the important role that custom plays in forming our world outlook
D) custom has little to do with our ways of thinking
37.	Which of the following is true according to John Dewey?
A) An individual can exercise very little influence on the cultural tradition into which he is born.
B) Custom is the direct result of the philosophical probing of a group of people.
C) An individual is strongly influenced by the cultural tradition even before he is born.

One major decision which faces the American students ready to begin higher education is the choice of attending a large university or a small college. The large university provides a wide range of specialized departments, as well numerous (71) courses within such departments. The small college, therefore, (72) generally provides a limited number of courses and specializations but offer a better student-faculty ratio, thus (73) permit individualized attention to students. Because of its large (74) student body (often exceeding 20,000) consisting in many (75) people from different countries the university exposes its students to many different culture, social and out-of-class (76) programmes. On the other hand, the smaller, more homogenous student body of the big college (77) affords greater opportunities in such activities. Finally, the university closely approximates the real world and which (78) provides a relaxed, impersonal, and sometimes anonymous existence, on the contrast, the intimate (79) atmosphere of the small college allows the student four years of structural living in which to expect and preparing for the real (80) world. In making his choice among educational institutions the student must, therefore, consider a great many factors.

Passage One
I grew up in a small town. My father raised chickens and ran a construction company. I was barely 10 years old when dad gave me the responsibility of feeding the chickens and cleaning up the stable. He believed it was important to me to have those jobs to learn responsibility and moods. Then, when I was 22, I found a job in Nashville at a country music sub-club called “The Nashville Palace “. I washed dishes and cooked from 4:00p.m. to 9:00p.m. and then went on stage and sand until 2:00 in the morning. It wasn’t long before I became known as a singing cook. I had been rejected so many times by record companies that it was hard not to be discouraged. One night, a woman executive from a company named Warner Brothers Records came to hear me sing. When the show was over, we sat down and talked and after she left, I said to myself it was one more rejection. A few weeks later, my manager received a phone call- Warner Brothers wanted to sign me to a record deal. Soon after, I released my first record in June, 1986. It sold over 2 million copies. My best efforts had gone into every job I ever held. It was the sense of responsibility that made me feel like a man. Knowing that I had done my best filled me with pride. I still feel that way today, even though I have become a well-known singer.
Questions 11 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	Why was the speaker once known as the singing cook?
12.	Who first recognized his talents and offered him a big deal?

Passage Two
You should not fear spiders because of their poison. Of all the spiders in North America, only one kind is really dangerous and most would not bite even if they were handled. They much prefer to run away or to drop to the ground on a thread of silk. Even so, when a spider runs directly toward a person, it gives the impression that it is about to attack. Actually, it cannot see the person in its way. The spider is too short-sighted to see things at a distance. It only wants to go where it won’t be disturbed. In the United States one kind of spider is responsible for the frightening reputation of the rest. It is the Black Widow, so called because the female, which is larger than the male, often eats her husband after making love. The Black Widow is found in all states but is most common in the south and the west. She constructs a loose, irregular web under a pile of ruins or near the foundations of buildings where she is seldom disturbed. She is not an attacking spider and many people have proven this by letting her crawl over their hands. When she bites, it is usually in self-defense. In spite of the stories you may have heard, it is rare for a person to be bitten by a Black Widow and even more unusual for the bite to prove fatal. But remember that her poison is powerful and even though she is shy, she should be respected.
Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
15.	What is this passage mainly about?
16.	What do we learn about the spiders from the passage?
17.	Why is the spider you just heard about called the Black Widow?
Passage Three
Mr. Bascomb was upset. At time like this he wished he had never become a candidate for mayor. Everything had gone wrong that morning. Even before leaving the house, he had received a telephone call from his election campaign manager asking for money. This made him angry and he left the house in a bad mood. When Mr. Bascomb arrived at the office, he could feel his head swinging. He reached for medicine but the bottle was empty. He had forgotten to pick up some medicine at the drug store. Mr. Bascomb looked at his watch. He was to deliver a campaign speech before a group of business men at the club at 11 o’clock. He had given a rough draft of his speech to Barbara the day before and asked her to type it out for him. Just then, the telephone rang. It was Barbara. She explained that her car had broken down and she couldn’t be at work until 12 o’clock. Mr. Bascomb was desperate. He didn’t know what to do. He was very nervous when he arrived at the club. He couldn’t remember anything he had planned to say to his audience. He started talking about himself and his problems instead of talking about the problems of the city. Most of the people in the audience were bored. By the time Mr. Bascomb finished his speech, almost everyone had fallen into sleep or left the room.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them the re are four choices marked A)，B)，C), and D). you should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
More and more, the operations of our businesses, governments, and financial institutions are controlled by information that exists only inside computer memories. Anyone clever enough to modify this information for his own purposes can reap substantial rewards. Even worse, a number of people who have done this and been caught at it have managed to get away without punishment.
It’s easy for computer crimes to go undetected if no one checks up on what the computer is doing. But even if the crime is detected, the criminal may walk away not only unpunished but with a glowing recommendation from his former employers.
Of course, we have no statistics on crimes that go undetected. But it’s disturbing to note how many of the crimes we do know about were detected by accident, not by systematic inspections or other security procedures. The computer criminals who have been caught may been the victims of uncommonly bad luck.
For example, a certain keypunch (键盘打孔) operator complained of having to stay overtime to punch extra cards. Investigation revealed that the extra cards she was being asked to punch were for dishonest transactions. In another case, dissatisfied employees of the thief tipped off (向…透露) the company that was being robbed.
Unlike other lawbreakers, who must leave the country, commit suicide, or go to jail, computer criminals sometimes escape punishment, demanding not only that they not be charged but that they be given good recommendations and perhaps other benefits. All too often, their demands have been met.
Why? Because company executives are afraid of the bad publicity that would result if the public found out that their computer had been misused. They hesitate at the thought of a criminal boasting in open court of how he juggled (耍弄) the most confidential records right under the noses of the company’s executives, a accountant, and security staff. And so another computer criminal departs with just the recommendations he needs to continue his crimes elsewhere.
21.	It can be concluded from the passage that ________.
A) it is still impossible to detect computer crimes today
B) computer crimes are the most serious problem in the operation of financial institutions
C) computer criminals can escape punishment because they can’t be detected
D) people commit computer crimes at the request their company
22.	It is implied in the third paragraph that ________.
A) many more computer crimes go undetected than are discovered
B) the rapid increase of computer crimes is a troublesome problem
C) most computer criminals are smart enough to cover up their crimes
D) most computer criminals are smart enough to cover up their bad luck
23.	Which of the following is mentioned in the passage?
A) A strict law against computer crimes must be enforced.
B) Companies need to impose restrictions on confidential information.
C) Companies will guard against computer crimes to protect their reputation.
D) Companies usually hesitate to uncover computer crimes.
24.	What may happen to computer criminals once they are caught?
A) With a bad reputation they can hardly find another job.
B) They will be denied access to confidential records.
C) They may walk away and easily find another job.
D) They must leave the country or go to jail.
25.	The passage is mainly about ________.
A) why computer crimes are difficult to detect by systematic inspections
B) why computer criminals are often able to escape punishment
C) how computer criminals manage to get good recommendation from their former employers
D) why computer crimes can’t be eliminated
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
It is often claimed that nuclear energy is something we cannot do without. We live in a consumer society where there is an enormous demand for commercial products of all kinds. Moreover, an increase in industrial production is considered to be one solution to the problem of mass unemployment. Such an increase presumes an abundant and cheap energy supply. Many people believe that nuclear energy provides an inexhaustible and economical source of power and that it is therefore essential for an industrially developing society. There are a number of other advantages in the use of nuclear energy. Firstly, nuclear power, except for accidents, is clean. A further advantage is that a nuclear power station can be run and maintained by relatively few technical and administrative staff. The nuclear reactor represents an enormous step in our scientific evolution and, whatever the anti nuclear group says, it is wrong to expect a return to more primitive sources of fuel. However, opponents of nuclear energy point out that nuclear power stations bring a direct threat not only to the environment but also to civil liberties.
Furthermore, it is questionable whether ultimately nuclear power is a cheap source of energy. There have, for example, been very costly accidents in America, in Britain and, of course, in Russia. The possibility of increases in the cost of uranium (铀) in addition to the cost of greater safety provisions could price nuclear power out of the market. In the long run, environmentalists argue, nuclear energy wastes valuable resources and disturbs the ecology to an extent which could bring about the destruction of the human race. Thus, if we wish to survive, we cannot afford nuclear energy. In spite of the case against nuclear energy outlined above, nuclear energy programmes are expanding. Such an expansion assumes a continual growth in industrial production and consumer demands. However, it is doubtful whether this growth will or can continue. Having weighed up the arguments on both sides, it seems there are good economic and ecological reasons for sources of energy other than nuclear power.
26.	The writer’s attitude toward nuclear energy is ________.
A) indifferent
B) favorable
C) tolerant
D) negative
27.	According to the opponents of nuclear energy, which of the following is true of nuclear energy?
A) Primitive
B) Exhaustible
C) Cheap
D) Unsafe
28.	Some people claim that nuclear energy is essential because ________.
A) it provides a perfect solution to mass unemployment
B) it represents an enormous step forward in our scientific evolution
C) it can meet the growing demand of an industrially developing society
D) nuclear power stations can be run and maintained by relatively few technical and administrative staff
29.	Which of the following statements does the writer support?
A) The demand for commercial products will not necessarily keep increasing.
B) Nuclear energy is something we cannot do without.
C) Uranium is a good source of energy for economic and ecological reasons.
D) Greater safety provisions can bring about the expansion of nuclear energy programmes.
30.	The function of the last sentence is to ________.
A) advance the final argument
B) reflect the writer’s attitude
C) reverse previously expressed thoughts
D) show the disadvantages of nuclear power
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Clothes play a critical part in the conclusions we reach by providing clues to who people are, who they are not, and who they would like to be. They tell us a good deal about the wearer’s background, personality, status, mood, and social outlook.
Since clothes are such an important source of social information, we can use them to manipulate people’s impression of us. Our appearance assumes particular significance in the initial phases of interaction that is likely to occur. An elderly middle class man or woman may be alienated (疏远…) by a young adult who is dressed in an unconventional manner, regardless of the person’s education, background, or interests.
People tend to agree on what certain types of clothes mean. Adolescent girls can easily agree on the lifestyles of girls who wear certain outfits (套装), including the number of boyfriends they likely have had and whether they smoke or drink. Newscasters, or the announcers who read the news on TV, are considered to be more convincing, honest, and competent when they are dressed conservatively. And collage students who view themselves as taking an active role in their inter-personal relationships say they are concerned about the costumes they must wear to play these roles successfully. Moreover, many of us can relate instances in which the clothing we wore changed the way we felt about ourselves and how we act ed. Perhaps you have used clothing to gain confidence when you anticipated a stressful situation, such as a job interview, or a court appearance.
In the workplace, men have long had well defined precedents and role models for achieving success. It has been otherwise for women. A good many women in the business world are uncertain about the appropriate mixture of “masculine” and “feminine” attributes they should convey by their professional clothing. The variety of clothing alternatives to women has also been greater than that avail able for men. Male administrators tend to judge women more favorably for managerial positions when the women display less “feminine” grooming (打扮)-shorter hair, moderate use of make up, and plain tailored clothing. As one male administrator confessed, “An attractive woman is definitely going to get a longer interview, but she won’t get a job.”

Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
The more women and minorities make their way into the ranks of management, the more they seem to want to talk about things formerly judged to be best left unsaid. The newcomers also tend to see office matters with a fresh eye, in the process sometimes coming up with critical analyses of the forces that shape everyone’s experience in the organization.
Consider the novel views of Harvey Coleman of Atlanta on the subject of getting ahead. Coleman is black. He spent 11 years with IBM, half of them working in management development, and now serves as a consultant to the likes of AT&T, Coca Cola, Prudential, and Merch. Coleman says that based on what he’s seen at big companies, he weighs the different elements that make for long term career success as follows: performance counts a mere 10%, image, 30%; and exposure, a full 60%. Coleman concludes that excellent job performance is so common these days that while doing your work well may win you pay increases, it won’t secure you the big promotion. He finds that advancement more often depends on how many people know you and your work, and how high up they are.
Ridiculous beliefs? Not to many people, especially many women and members of minority races who, like Coleman, feel that the scales (障眼物) have dropped from their eyes. “Women and blacks in organizations work under false beliefs,” says Kaleel Jamison, a New York based management consultant who helps corporations deal with these issues. “They think that if you work hard, you’ll get ahead—that someone in authority will reach down and give you a promotion.” She adds, “Most women and blacks are so frightened that people will think they’ve gotten ahead because of their sex or color that they play down (使不突出) their visibility.” Her advice to those folks: learn the ways that white males have traditionally used to find their way into the spotlight.
36.	According to the passage, “things formerly judged to be best left unsaid” (Line 2, Para. 1) probably refers to “________”.
A) criticisms that shape everyone’s experience

C) the tendencies that help the newcomers to see office matters with a fresh eye
D) the ideas which usually come up with usually come up with new ways of management in the organization

A) let your superiors know how good you are

C) work as a consultant to your superiors

Part IV Short Answer Questions (15 minutes)
Directions:	In this part there is a short passage with five questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words.
Joe Templer should have known better: after all, he works for a large auto insurance company. It won’t hurt to leave the key in the truck this once, he thought, as he filled his gas tank at a self service gas station. But moments latter as he was paying the money he saw the truck being driven away.
In 1987, 1.6 million motor vehicles were stolen in the United States-one every 20 seconds. If current trends continue, experts predict annual vehicle thefts could exceed two million by the end of the decade.
Vehicle theft is a common phenomenon, which has a direct impact on over four million victims a year. The cost is astonishing.
Many police officials blame professional thieves for the high volume of thefts. It is a major money maker for organized crime. Typically, stolen cars are taken to pieces and the parts sold to individuals. But as many as 200,000 cars a re smuggled out of the country every year. Most go to Latin America, the Middle East and Europe.
Only about 15 percent car thefts result in an arrest, because few police departments routinely conduct in depth auto investigations. When thieves are arrested, judges will often sentence them to probation (缓刑), not immediately put them in prison because the prisons are overcrowded with violent criminals.
One exception is a Michigan program that assigns 92 police officers to work full time on the state’s 65,000 car theft cases a year. Since 1986, when the effort began, the state’s auto theft rate has fallen from second in the nation to ninth.
How can you protect your car? If you live in a high theft area or drive an expensive model, consider a security system. It may cost anywhere from $25 to $1,000. Some systems engage automatically simply removing the key disables the fuel pump and the starter. When cars are equipped with such systems, thefts may drop by one third. In some states, you may be able to use a device that transmits radio signals, allowing stolen cars to be tracked by police.
Questions:
71.	What is the passage mainly about?
________________________________________________________________.
72.	What does the author think Joe Templer should be blamed for?
________________________________________________________________.
73.	How serious did the author predict the annual vehicle theft could in the United States in 1989?

Passage Two
Movies are the most popular form of entertainment for millions of Americans. They go to the movies to escape their normal everyday existence and to experience a life more exciting than their own. They may choose to see a particular film because they like the actor or because they’ve heard the film has a good story. But the main reason why people go to the movies is to escape. Sitting in a dark theatre, watching the images on the screen, they entered another world that is very real to them. They become involved in the lives of the characters in the movie, and for two hours, they forget all about their own problems. They are in a dream world where things often appear to be more romantic and beautiful than in real life. The biggest “dream factories” are in Hollywood, the capital of film industry. Each year, Hollywood studios make hundreds of movies that are shown allover the world.
American movies are popular because they tell interesting stories and they are well—made. They provide the public with heroes who do things the average person would like to do but often can’t. People have to cope with many problems and frustrations in their life, so they feel encouraged when they see “the good guys” win in the movies.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What’s the main reason for the Americans to go to the movies?
15.	How do people usually respond when they are watching movies?
16.	Why are Americans movies so popular?
Passage Three
A recent film “The Gods Must Be Crazy” described the social change that can result in a society from the introduction of a single item from the outside world. While a pilot was fling in a light plane over a remote desert in South Africa, he finished the soda he was drinking and threw the bottle out of the window. It fell to the ground in an area where an African tribe lived. The people there had almost no possession or sense of private property. No one in this small, remote society had seen a soda bottle before. And, because it came from the sky, they believed that it must be a unique gift from the gods. When the bottle was first found, it was something new and people of all ages enjoyed admiring it, playing with it, and thinking about its purpose. It was not long, however, before arguments and conflicts arose among group members about who would possess the bottle and for what purpose. They harmony of this peaceful society was disturbed by the introduction of a new item of technology. And, as it was told in the film, ties of affection were broken, and people’s trust in each other disappeared.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is following by some questions or unfinished statements-For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:
It is said that the public and Congressional concern about deceptive packaging rumpus started because Senator Hart discovered that the boxes of cereals consumed by him, Mrs. Hart, and their children were becoming higher and narrower, with a decline of net weight from 12 to 10.5 ounces, without any reduction in price. There were still twelve biscuits, but they had been reduced in size. Later, the Senator rightly complained of a store-bought pie in a handsomely illustrated box that pictured, in a single slice, almost as many cherries as there were in the whole pie.
The manufacturer who increases the unit price of his product by changing his package size to lower the quantity delivered can, without undue hardship, put his product into boxes, bags, and tins that will contain even 4-ounce, 8-ounce, one-pound, two-pound quantities of breakfast foods, cake mixes, etc. A study of drugstore and supermarket shelves will convince any observer that all possible size and shapes of boxes, jars, bottles, and tins are in use at the same time and, as the package journals show, week by week, there is never any hesitation in introducing a new size, and shape of box or bottle when it aids in product differentiation. The producers of packaged products argue strongly against changing sizes of packages to contain even weights and volumes, but no one in the trade comments unfavorably on the huge costs incurred by endless changes of package sizes, materials, shape, art work, and net weights that are used for improving a product’s market position.
When a packaging expert explained that he was able to multiply the price of hard sweets by 2.5, from 1 dollar to 2.50 dollars by changing to a fancy jar, or that he had made a 5-ounce bottle look as though it held 8 ounces, he was in effect telling the public that packaging can be a very expensive luxury. It evidently does come high, when an average family pays about 200 dollars a year for bottles, cans, boxes, jars and other containers, most of which can’t be used anything but stuffing the garbage can.
21.	What started the public and Congressional concern about deceptive packaging rumpus?
A) Consumers’ complaints about the changes in the package size.
B) Expensive packaging for poor quality products.
C) A senator’s discovery of the tricks in packaging.
D) The rise in the unit price for many products.
22.	The word “undue” (Para. 2) means “________”.
A) improper
B) adequate
C) unexpected
D) excessive
23.	Consumers are concerned about the changes in the package size, mainly because ________.
A) they hate to see any changes in things they are familiar with
B) they unit price for a product often rises as a result
C) they have to pay for the cost of changing package sizes
D) this entails an increase in the cost of packaging
24.	According to this passage, various types of packaging come into existence to ________.
A) meet the needs of consumers
B) suit all kinds of products
C) enhance the market position of products
D) introduce new products
25.	The author is critical mainly of ________.
A) dishonest packaging
B) inferior packaging
C) the changes in package size
D) exaggerated illustrations on packages
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
If sustainable competitive advantage depends on work-force skills, American firms have a problem. Human-resource management is not traditionally seen as central to the competitive survival of the firm in United States. Skill acquisition is considered an individual responsibility. Labour is simply another factor of production to be hired-rented at the lowest possible cost-much as one buys raw materials or equipment.
The lack of importance attached to human-resource management can be seen in the corporate hierarchy. In an American firm the chief financial officer is almost always second in command. The post of head of human-resource management is usually a specialized job, off at the edge of the corporate hierarchy. The executive who holds it is never consulted on major strategic decisions and has no chance to move up to Chief Executive Officer (CEO). By way of contrast, in Japan the head of human-resource management is central-usually the second most important executive, after the CEO, in the firm’s hierarchy.
While American firms often talk about the vast amounts spent on training their work forces, in fact they invest less in the skills of their employees than do either Japanese or German firms. The money they do invest is also more highly concentrated on professional and managerial employees. And the limited investments that are made in training workers are also much more narrowly focused on the specific skills necessary to do the next job rather than on the basic background skills that make it possible to absorb new technologies.
As a result, problems emerge when new breakthrough technologies arrive. If American workers, for example, take much longer to learn how to operate new flexible manufacturing stations than workers in Germany (as they do), the effective cost of those stations is lower in Germany than it is in the United States. More time is required before equipment is up and running at capacity, and the need for extensive retraining generates costs and creates bottlenecks that limit the speed with which new equipment can be employed. The result is as lower pace of technological change. And in the end the skills of the population affect the wages of the top half. If the bottom half can’t effectively staff the processes that have to be operated, the management and professional jobs that to with these processes will disappear.
26.	Which of the following applies to the management of human resources in American companies?
A) They hire people at the lowest cost regardless of their skills.
B) They see the gaining of skills as their employees’ own business.
C) They attach more importance to workers than equipment.
D) They only hire skilled workers because of keen competition.
27.	What is the position of the head of human-resource management in an American firm?
A) He is one of the most important executives in firms.
B) His post is likely to disappear when new technologies are introduced.
C) He is directly under the chief financial executives in the firms.
D) He has no say in making important decisions in the firm.
28.	The money most American firms put in training mainly goes to ________.
A) workers who can operate new equipment
B) technological and managerial staff
C) workers who lack basic background skills
D) top executives
29.	According to the passages, the decisive factor in maintaining a firm’s competitive advantage is ________.
A) the introduction of new technologies
B) the improvement of worker’s basic skills
C) the rational composition of professional and managerial employees
D) the attachment of importance to the bottom half of the employees

Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
The biographer has to dance between two shaky positions with respect to the subject. Too close a relation, and the writer may be objectivity. Not close enough, and the writer may lack the sympathy necessary to any effort to portray a mind, a soul-the quality of life. Who should write the biography of a family, for example? Because of their closeness to the subject, family members may have special information, but by the same token, they may not have the distance that would allow them to be fair. Similarly, a king’s servant might not be the best one to write a biography of that king. But a foreigner might not have the knowledge and sympathy necessary to write the king’s biography-not for a readership from within the kingdom, at any rate.
There is no ideal position for such a task. The biographer has to work with the position he or she has in the world, adjusting that position as necessary to deal with the subject. Every position has strengths and weaknesses: to thrive, a writer must try to become aware of these, evaluate them in terms of the subject, and select a position accordingly.
When their subjects are heroes or famous figures, biographies often reveal a democratic motive: they attempt to show that their subjects are only human, no better than anyone else. Other biographies are meant to change us, to invite us to become better than we are. The biographies of Jesus found in the Bible are in this class.
Biographers may claim that their account is the “authentic” one. In advancing this claim, they are helped if the biography is “authorized” by the subject, this presumably allows the biographer special access to private information. “Unauthorized” biographies also have their appeal, however, since they can suggest an independence of mind in the biographer. In book promotions, the “unauthorized” characterisation usually suggests the prospect of juicy gossip that the subject had hoped to suppress. A subject might have several biographies, even several “authentic” ones. We sense intuitively that no one is in a position to tell the story of a life, perhaps not even the subject, and this has been proved by the history of biography.
31.	According to the author, an ideal biographer would be one who ________.
A) knows the subject very well and yet maintains a proper distance from him
B) is close to the subject and knows the techniques of biography writing
C) is independent and treats the subject with fairness and objectivity
D) possesses special private information and is sympathetic toward the subject
32.	The author cites the biographies of Jesus in the Bible in order to show that ________.
A) the best biographies are meant to transform their readers
B) biographies are authentic accounts of their subjects’ lives
C) the best biographies are the of heroes and famous figures
D) biographies can serve different purpose
33.	Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage?
A) An authentic biography seldom appeals to its readers.
B) An authentic biography is one authorized by the subject.
C) No one can write a perfect biography.
D) Authorized biographies have a wider readership.
34.	An unauthorized biography is likely to attract more readers because ________.
A) it portrays the subject both faithfully and vividly
B) it contains interesting information about the subject’s private life
C) it reveals a lot of accurate details unknown to outsiders
D) it usually gives a sympathetic description of the subject’s character
35.	In this passage, the author focuses on ________.
A) the difficulty of a biographer in finding the proper perspective to do his job
B) the secret of a biographer to win more readers
C) the techniques required of a biographer to write a food biography
D) the characteristics of different kinds of biographies
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Whether the eyes are “the windows of the soul” is debatable, that they are intensely important in interpersonal communication is a fact. During the first two months of a baby’s life, the stimulus that produces a smile is a pair of eyes. The eyes need not be real: a mask with two dots will produce a smile. Significantly, a real human face with eyes then the face will not motivate a smile, nor will the sight of only one eye then the face is presented in profile. This attraction to eyes as opposed to the nose or mouth continues as the baby matures. In one study, when American four-year-olds were asked to draw people, 75 percent of them drew people with mouths, but 99 percent of them drew people with eyes. In Japan, however, where babies are carried on their mother’s back, infants to not acquire as much attachment to eyes as they do in other cultures. As a result, Japanese adults make little use of the face either to encode or decode meaning. In fact, Argyle reveals that the “proper place to focus one’s gaze during a conversation in Japan is on the neck of one’s conversation partner.”
The role of eye contact in a conversational exchange between two Americans is well defined: speakers make contact with the eyes of their listener for about one second, then glance away as they talk; in a few moments they re-establish eye contact with the listener or reassure themselves that their audience is still attentive, then shift their gaze away once more. Listeners, meanwhile, keep their eyes on the face of the speaker, allowing themselves-to glance away only briefly. It is important that they be looking at the speaker at the `precise moment when the speaker reestablishes eye contact: if they are not looking, the speaker assumes that they are disinterested and either will pause until eye contact is resumed or will terminate the conversation. Just how critical this eye maneuvering is to the maintenance of conversational flow becomes evident when two speakers are wearing dark glasses: there may be a sort of traffic jam of words caused by interruption, false starts, and unpredictable pauses.
36.	The author is convinced that the eyes are ________.
A) of extreme importance in expressing feelings and exchanging ideas
B) something through which one can see a person’s inner world
C) of considerable significance in making conversations interesting
D) something the value of which is largely a matter of long debate
37.	Babies will not be stimulated to smile by a person ________.
A) whose front view is fully perceived
B) whose face is covered with a mask
C) whose face is seen from the side
D) whose face is free of any covering
38.	According to the passage, the Japanese fix their gaze on their conversation partner’s neck because ________.
A) they don’t like to keep their eyes on the face of the speaker
B) they need not communicate through eye contact
C) they don’t think it polite to have eye contact
D) they didn’t have much opportunity to communicate through eye contact in babyhood
39.	According to the passage, a conversation between two Americans may break down due to ________.
A) one temporarily glancing away from the other
B) eye contact of more than one second
C) improperly-timed ceasing of eye contact
D) constant adjustment of eye contact
40.	To keep a conversation flowing smoothly, it is better for the participants ________.
A) not to wear dark spectacles
B) not to make any interruptions
C) not to glance away from each other
D) not to make unpredictable pauses

Part IV short Answer Questions (15 minutes)
Directions:	In this part there is a short passage with five questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements is the fewest possible word.
I once knew a dog named Newton who had a unique sense of humour. Whenever I tossed out a Frisbee for him to chase, he’d take off in hot pursuit but then seem to lose track of it. Moving back and forth only a yard of two from the toy, Newton would look all around, even up into the trees. He seemed genuinely puzzled. Finally, I’d give up and head into the field to help him out. But no sooner would I get within 10 ft. Of him than he would run invariably straight over to the Frisbee, grab it and start running like mad, looking over his shoulder with what looked suspiciously like a grin.
Just about every pet owner has a story like this and is eager to share it with anyone who will listen. On very short notice, TIME reporters cam up with 25 stories about what each is convinced is the smartest pet in the world. Among them: the cat who closes the door behind him when he goes into the bathroom; the cat who uses a toilet instead of a litter box... and flushes it afterward; the dog who goes wild when he sees his owner putting on blue jeans instead of a dress because jeans mean it is time to play; and the cat who used to wait patiently at the bus stop every day for a little girl, then walk her the six blocks home. And so on.
These behaviours are certainly clever, but what do they mean? Was Newton really deceiving? Can a cat really desire privacy in the toilet? In short, do household pets really have a mental and emotional life? Their owners think so, but until recently, animal-behaviour exports would have gone mad on hearing such a question. The worst sin in the worst sin in their moral vocabulary was anthropomorphism, projecting human traits onto animals. A dog or a cat might behave as if it were angry, lonely, sad, happy or confused, but that was only in the eye of the viewer. What was going on, they insisted was that the dog or cat had been conditioned, through a perhaps unintentional series of punishments and rewards, the behave certain way. The behaviour was a mechanical result of the training.
71.	What did Newton seem puzzled about?
72.	Why does the author say Newton had unique sense of humour?
73.	What made it possible for the TIME reporters to come up with so many interesting stories about pets?
74.	What belief about pet behaviour was unacceptable to experts of animal behaviour?
75.	What is the explanation of animal-behaviour experts for the “clever” behaviour of pets?

Passage One
Today, air travel is far safer than driving a car on a busy motorway. But there is the danger that grows every year. From the moment the airplane takes off to the moment it lands, every movement is watched on radar screens. Air traffic controllers tell the pilot exactly when to turn, when to climb and when to come down. The air traffic controllers around the busy airport may handle 1,000 planes a day. Any plane that flies near the airport comes under the orders of the controllers there. Even a small mistake on their part could cause a disaster. Recently, such a disaster almost happened. Two large jets were flying towards the airport. One was carrying 69 passengers and had come from Toronto; the other was carrying 176 passengers from Chicago. An air traffic controller noticed on his radar screen that the two planes were too close to each other. He ordered one to turn to the right to climb, but he made a mistake. He ordered the wrong plane to do this, so, instead of turning away from the second plane. The first plane turned towards it. 15 seconds later, it flew directly in front of the second plane. They avoided each other by the smallest part of a second. The distance between them was less than that of a large swimming pool. This is an example of the danger that grows every year.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	Which factor can most seriously endanger airplanes according to this passage?
12.	What happened to the two large jets?
13.	Why were the two large jets specially mentioned?
Passage Two
I’ll still be working, but things would be different. With any luck, I’ll earn more money. But the most important thing will be the job itself and how interesting it is. I mean, I hope I’ll be able to choose the kind of job I do and who I work for. Of course, I like to have more money and more authority that I have now. But I don’t think they are the only thing in life. What I really want is to be more independent than I am now, to have more control over my own life, perhaps to open a small restaurant, or write a book, or something like that. I am not really sure if I’ll ever have children or even if I want to be married. It all depends, of course. I f I meet the right person anything could happen. But I won’t feel that my life is empty and meaningless if I still live alone for 10 years or even 20 years from now. Not at all. My mother was always saying “There is nothing like a good relationship “. But I am not so sure. There is nothing worse than a really bad one either.

Passage Three
Jane Adams came from a well-to-do and cultural family. She was so distressed about the misery of poor people that she left her fine home to spend her life in the slums of Chicago. In 1889, she established a settlement house where she initiated many projects such as hot lunch service for factory workers, day care centers for little children, free classes for young people and adults, gymnasium and art gallery.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them the re are four choices marked A)，B)，C), and D). you should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
A few common misconceptions. Beauty is only skin deep. One’s physical assets and liabilities don’t count all that much in a managerial career. A woman should always try to look her best.
Over the last 30 years, social scientists have conducted more than 1,000 studies of how we react to beautiful and not so beautiful people. The virtually unanimous conclusion: Looks do matter, more than most of us realize. The data suggest, for example, that physically attractive individuals are more likely to be treated well by their parents, sought out as friends, and pursued romantically. With the possible exception of women seeking managerial jobs, they are also more likely to be hired, paid well, and promoted.
Un American, you say, unfair and extremely unbelievable? Once again, the scientists have caught us mouthing pieties (虔诚) while acting just the contrary. Their typical experiment works something like this. They give each member of a group-college students, or teachers or corporate personnel mangers-a piece of paper relating an individual’s accomplishments. Attached to the paper is a photograph. While the papers all say exactly the same thing the pictures are different. Some show a strikingly attractive person, some an average looking character, and some an unusually unattractive human being. Group members are asked to rate the individual on certain attributes, anything from personal warmth to the likelihood that he or she will be promoted.
Almost invariably, the better looking the person in the picture, the higher the person is rated. In the phrase, borrowed from Sappho, that the social scientists use to sum up the common perception, what is beautiful is good.
In business, however, good looks cut both ways for women, and deeper than for men. A Utah State University professor, who is an authority on the subject, explains: In terms of their careers, the impact of physical attractiveness on males is only modest. But its potential impact on females can be tremendous, making it easier, for example, for the more attractive to get jobs where they are in the public eye. On another note, though, there is enough literature now for us to conclude that attractive women who aspire (追求) to managerial positions do not get on as well as women who may be less attractive.
21.	According to the passage, people often wrongly believe that in pursuing a career as a manager ________.
A) a person’s property or debts do not matter much
B) a person’s outward appearance is not a critical qualification
C) women should always dress fashionably
D) women should not only be attractive but also high minded
22.	The result of research carried out by social scientists show that ________.
A) people do not realize the importance of looking one’s best
B) women in pursuit of managerial jobs are not likely to be paid well
C) good looking women aspire to managerial positions
D) attractive people generally have an advantage over those who are not
23.	Experiments by scientists have shown that when people evaluate individuals on certain attributes ________.
A) they observe the principle that beauty is only skin deep
B) they do not usually act according to the views they support
C) they give ordinary looking persons the lowest ratings
D) they tend to base their judgment on the individual’s accomplishments
24.	“Good looks cut both ways for women” (Line 1, Para. 5) means that ________.
A) attractive women have tremendous potential impact on public jobs
B) good looking women always get the best of everything
C) being attractive is not always an advantage for women
D) attractive women do not do as well as unattractive women in managerial positions
25.	It can be inferred from the passage that in the business world ________.
A) handsome men are not affected as much by their looks as attractive women are
B) physically attractive women who are in the public eye usually do quite well
C) physically attractive men and women who are in the public eye usually get along quite well
D) good looks are important for women as they are for men
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:
Not content with its doubtful claim to produce cheap food for our own population, the factory farming industry also argues that “hungry nations are benefiting from advances made by the poultry (家禽) industry”. In fact, rather than helping the fight against malnutrition (营养不良) in “hungry nations,” the spread of factory farming has, inevitably aggravated the problem.
Large scale intensive meat and poultry production is a waste of food resources.
This is because more protein has to be fed to animals in the form of vegetable matter than can ever be recovered in the form of meat. Much of the food value is lost in the animal’s process of digestion and cell replacement. Neither, in the ca se of chicken, can one eat feathers, blood, feet or head. In all, only about 44% of the live animal fits to be eaten as meat.
This means one has to feed approximately 9—10 times as much food value to the animal than one can consume from the carcass. As a system for feeding the hungry, the effects can prove disastrous. At times of crisis, grain is the food of life.
Nevertheless, the huge increase in poultry production throughout Asia and Africa continues. Normally British or US firms are involved. For instance, an American based multinational company has this year announced its involvement in projects in several African countries. Britain’s largest suppliers chickens, Ross Breeders, are also involved in projects all over the world.
Because such trade is good for exports, Western governments encourage it. In 1979, a firm in Bangladesh called Phoenix Poultry received a grant to set up a unit of 6,000 chickens and 18,000 laying hens. This almost doubled the number of poultry kept in the country all at once.
But Bangladesh lacks capital, energy and food and has large numbers of unemployed. Such chicken raising demands capital for building and machinery, extensive use of energy resources for automation, and involves feeding chickens with potential famine relief protein food. At present, one of Bangladesh’s main imports is food grains, because the country is unable to grow enough food to feed its population. On what then can they possibly feed the chicken?
26.	In this passage the author argues that ________.
A) efficiency must be raised in the poultry industry
B) raising poultry can provide more protein than growing grain
C) factory farming will do more harm than good to developing countries
D) hungry nations may benefit from the development of the poultry industry
27.	According to the author, in factory, vegetable food ________.
A) is easy for chickens to digest
B) is insufficient for the needs of poultry
C) is fully utilised in meat and egg production
D) is inefficiently converted into meat and eggs
28.	Western governments encourage the poultry industry in Asia because they regard it as an effective way to ________.
A) boost their own exports
B) alleviate malnutrition in Asian countries
C) create job opportunities in Asian countries
D) promote the exports of Asian countries
29.	The word “carcass” (Line 2, Para. 3) most probably means “________”.
A) vegetables preserved for future use
B) the dead body of an animal ready to be cut into meat
C) expensive food that consumers can hardly afford
D) meat canned for future consumption
30.	What the last paragraph tells us is the author’s ________.
A) detailed analysis of the ways of raising poultry in Bangladesh
B) great appreciation of the development of poultry industry in Bangladesh
C) critical view on the development of the poultry industry in Bangladesh
D) practical suggestion for the improvement of the poultry industry in Bangladesh
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
We all have offensive breath at one time or another. In most cases, offensive breath emanates from bacteria in the mouth, although there are other more causes.
Until a few years ago, the most doctors could do was to counsel patients with bad breath about oral cleanliness. Now they are finding new ways to treat the usually curable condition.
Bad breath can happen whenever the normal flow of saliva (唾液) slows. Our mouths are full of bacteria feeding on protein in bits of food and shed tissue. The bacteria emit evil smelling gases, the worst of which is hydrogen sulfide (硫 化物).
Mouth bacteria thrive in airless conditions. Oxygen rich saliva keeps their numbers down. When we sleep, for example, the saliva stream slows, and sulfur producing bacteria gain the upper hand, producing classic “morning breath”.
Alcohol hunger, too much talking, breathing through the mouth during exercise anything that dries the mouth produces bad breath. So can stress, though it’s not understood why. Some people’s breath turns sour every time they go on a job interview.
Saliva flow gradually slows with age, which explains why the elderly have more bad breath trouble than younger people do. Babies, however, who make plenty of saliva and whose mouths contain relatively few bacteria have characteristically sweet breath.
For most of us, the simple, dry mouth variety of bad breath is easily cured. Eating or drinking starts saliva and sweeps away many of the bacteria. Breakfast often stops morning breath.
Those with chronic dry mouth find that it helps to keep gum, hard candy, or a bottle of water or juice around. Brushing the teeth wipes out dry mouth bad breath because it clears away many of the offending bacteria.
Surprisingly, one thing that rarely works is mouthwash. The liquid can mask bad breath odor with its own smell, but the effect lasts no more than an hour. Some mouthwashes claim to kill the bacteria responsible for bad breath. The trouble is, they don’t necessarily reach all offending germs. Most bacteria are well protected from mouthwash under thick layers of mucus (粘液). If the mouthwash contains alcohol-as most do-it can intensify the problem by drying out the mouth.
31.	The phrase “emanate from” in Paragraph 1 most probably means “________”.
A) thrive on
B) account for
C) originate from
D) descend from
32.	Which of the following is mentioned as one of the causes of bad breath?
A) Tooth trouble.
B) Sulfur rich food.
C) Too much exercise.
D) Mental strain.
33.	According to the passage, alcohol has something to do with bad breath mainly because ________.
A) it keeps offending bacteria from reproducing
B) its smell adds to bad breath
C) it kills some helpful bacteria
D) it affects the normal flow of saliva
34.	Mouthwashes are not an effective cure for bad breath mainly because ________.
A) they can’t mask the bad odor long enough
B) they can’t get to all the offending bacteria
C) their strong smell mixes with bad breath and makes it worse
D) they can’t cover the thick layers of mucus
35.	We can infer from this passage that ________.
A) offensive breath can’t easily be cured
B) elderly people are less offended by bad breath
C) heavy drinkers are less affected by bad breath
D) offensive breath is less affected by alcohol
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
“Welcome to the U.S.A.! Major Credit cards accepted!”
By the millions they are coming no longer the tired, the poor, the wretched mass longing for a better living. These are the wealthy. “We don’t have a budget,” says a biologist from Brazil, as she walks with two companions through New York City’s South Street. “We just use our credit cards.”
The U.S. has long been one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, but this year has been exceptional. First there was the World Cup, which drew thousands from every corner of the globe; then came the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. Now the U.S., still the world’s superpower, can also claim to be the world’s bargain basement (廉价商品部). Nobody undersells America these days on just about everything, from consumer electronics to fashion clothes to tennis rackets. Bottom retail prices-anywhere from 30% to 70% lower than those in Europe and Asia-have attracted some 47 million visitors, who are expected to leave behind $79 billion in 1994. That’s up from $74 billion the year before.
True, not everyone comes just for brains. There remains an undeniable fascination in the rest of the world with all things American, nourished by Hollywood films and U.S. television series. But shopping the U.S.A. is proving irresistible. Every week thousands arrive with empty suitcases ready to be filled; some even rent an additional hotel room to hold their purchases. The buying binge (无节制) has become as important as watching Old Faithful Fountains erupt in Yellowstone Park or sunbathing on a beach in Florida.
The U.S. has come at last to appreciate what other countries learned long ago: the pouring in of foreign tourists may not always be convenient, but is does put money in the bank. And with a trade deficit at about $130 billion and growing for the past 12 months, the U.S. needs all the deposits it can get. Compared with American tourists abroad, visitors to the U.S. stay longer and spend more money at each stop; an average of 12.2 night and $1624 a traveller versus the American s’ four nights and $298.
36.	From what the Brazilian biologist says, we know that tourists like her ________.
A) are reluctant to carry cash with them
B) simply don’t care how much they spend
C) are not good at planning their expenditure
D) often spend more money than they can afford
37.	The reason why 1994 was exceptional is that ________.
A) it saw an unusually large number of tourists to the U.S.
B) it witnessed a drop in the number of tourists to the U.S.
C) tourism was hardly affected by the weakening of the U.S. dollar that year
D) tourists came to the U.S. for sightseeing rather than for bargains that year
38.	By saying “nobody undersells America” (Line 4, Para. 3), the author means that ________.
A) no other country underestimates the competitiveness of American products
B) nobody expects the Americans to cut the prices of their commodities
C) nobody restrains the selling of American goods
D) no other country sells at a lower price that America
39.	Why does the author assert that all things American are fascinating to foreigners?
A) Because they have gained much publicity through the American media.
B) Because they represent the world’s latest fashions.
C) Because they embody the most sophisticated technology.
D) Because they are available at all tourist destinations.
40.	From the passage we can conclude that the U.S. has come to realize ________.
A) the weakening if the U.S. dollar can result in trade deficits
B) the lower the retail prices, the greater the profits
C) tourism can make great contributions to its economy
D) visitors to the U.S. are wealthier than U.S. tourists abroad

Part IV Short Answer Questions (15 minutes)
Directions:	In this part there is a short passage with five questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words (not exceeding 10 words).
One summer my wife Chris and I were invited by friends to row down the Colorado River in a boat. Our expedition included many highly successful people the kind who have staffs to take care of life’s daily work. But in the wilder rapids, all of us naturally set aside any pretenses (矫饰) and put out backs into every stroke to keep the boat from tumbling over. At each night’s encampment, we all hauled supplies and cleaned dishes. After only two days in the river, people accustomed to being spoiled and indulged had become a team, working together to cope with the unpredictable twists and turns of the river.
I believe that in life as well as on boat trips teamwork will make all our journeys successful ones. The rhythms of teamwork have been the rhythms of my life. I played basketball alongside famous players, and the team I now coach, the New York Knicks, has recovered from years of adversity to become a major contender in the 1990s.
I’m persuaded that teamwork is the key to making dreams come true. We all play on a number of teams in our lives-as part of a family, as a citizen, as a member of an agreement, written or unwritten. It contains the values and goals for every team member.
For example, in the late 1970s a General Motors plant in Fremont, Calif, was the scene of constant warfare between labor and management. Distrust ran so high that the labor contract was hundreds of pages of tricky legal terms. GM spent millions trying to keep the facility up to date, but productivity and quality were continually poor. Absenteeism (旷工) was so out of control that the production line couldn’t even start up on some mornings. Finally in the early 1980s, GM shut down the plant.
GM became convinced that it had to create new production systems based on teamwork. In the mid 1980s it reopened the Fremont plant with Toyota, starting from scratch (从零开始) with a much simpler and shorter labor contract. It promised that executive salaries would be reduced and jobs performed by outside sellers would be given to employees before any layoffs were considered. Over a hundred job classifications were cut to just two. Instead of doing one boring job over and over, workers agreed to be part of small teams, spending equal time on various tasks.

Passage One
A community theatre is an important part of almost every city or town in the United States. There are over 2,000 community theatres in the United States today, about 4.5 million people work of perform in these theatres for an audience of more than 50 million people annually. These theatres are amateur organizations and are different from professional theatre companies. A community theatre may have its own building or perform in a school or church hall. The actors and actresses do not receive money for their work in the community theatre. They have other jobs to support themselves instead. Small communities can’t support a full time theatre. They cannot pay actors directors or stage workers, so the theatre participants work for free. One purpose of community theatre is to provide an opportunity for creative work. Many people join in community theatres because they want to perform or to be creative. Several people in a community theatre group were asked why they join. Each one said he or she needed to be creative, to do something original. One man said “I loved to act, it’s the only time I feel a life”. Another said, “I have a very boring job. In the play, I can create something.” One woman said “My whole life is occupied by husband and family. I need something more than that.” Another purpose of community theatre is to educate and improve the community. Theatre is an art that also introduces new ideas to the audience.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	How many people participate in the work of community theatres in the United States?
12.	How are community theatres different from professional theatre companies?
13.	What opportunity does the community theatre provide to the people in a community?
Passage Two
According to a new study done at the Medical School of University of California at Los Anglos, left handed people may be more likely to have accidents than the right handed. One reason maybe: left hander tend to make minor mental mistakes. In the study of 2000 sailors, those who had more mental errors also had more accidents, and left hander were reported to have more mental errors and more accidents than right hander. The author of the study Jim Watson said “Minor mental mistakes are mistakes that any adults would make when were tired or careless and they could lead to accidents because we lose track of what we are doing “. Paul White, chief of the study program said that he found the study interesting and exciting. But he warned that the conclusions should not be accepted without further investigation. He said the study had limitations, and limitations could have influenced the results. Jim Watson, who is right handed himself, stressed that the study was not an official project and said that the findings cannot be applied to every left hander. He said minor mental mistakes can be regarded as evidence of lack of concentration. But in the past, it was believed that left hander tended to have more accidents largely because most equipment was designed for right hander.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What is said about left hander in the study?
15.	What was said about the study program?
16.	What was the traditional explanation of left hander having more accidents?

On 15th, Feb, 1989 an instant survey was carried out among 18 overseas postgraduate students. 11 students were male and 7 were female, the purpose of the survey was to discover the views of the students on a number of matter so f personal concern. The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire given to the students to complete. There were five questions. The first question concerned favorite color and the second favorite number. The next 3 questions were all concerned with aspects of marriage. No.3 looked at the ideal age to get married, No.4 examined the qualities looked for in a partner and No.5 asked about the ideal number of children. The main findings were as follows: Blue was the most popular color. This was followed by Green and Purple. There was no real significance in the choice of lucky number. About one third of the students said that they had none. Sixty-one percent of the students selected the age group 26 to 30 years as ideal for marriage, followed by 21 to 25 years. In looking at the most important qualities in an ideal partner, someone hoped the person to be Intelligent, others chose Natural, still others indicated Attractive and Honest. The ideal number of children was 2, followed by 3. It is not easy to reach any definite conclusions based upon such a small sample of students from such widely different backgrounds. However, it is clear that majority favorite of 26 to 30 is the ideal age to get married with an intelligent partner, and producing 2 children.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A)，B), C), and D). You should divide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Cyberspace (网络空间)， data superhighways, mullet media-for those who have seen the future, the linking of computers, television and telephones will change our lives for ever, Yet for all the talk of a forthcoming technological utopia (乌托邦) little attention has been given to the implications of these developments for the poor. As with all new high technology, while the West concerns itself with the “how,” the question of “for whom” is put aside once again.
Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communications revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transitional corporations take full advantage of it. Terms of trade, exchange and interest rates and money movements are more important than the production of goods. The electronic economy made possible by information technology allows the haves to increase their control on global markets-with destructive impact on the have-nots.
For them the result is instability. Developing countries which rely on the production of a small range of goods for export are made to feel like small parts in the international economic machine. As “futures”(期货) are traded on computer screens, developing countries simply have less and less control of their destinies.
So what are the options for regaining control? One alternative is for developing countries to buy in the latest computers and telecommunications themselves-so-called “development communications” modernization. Yet this leads to long-term dependency and perhaps permanent constraints on developing countries’ economies.
Communications technology is generally exported from the U.S., Europe or Japan; the patents, skills and ability to manufacture remain in the hands of a few industrialized countries, It is also expensive, and imported products and services must therefore be bought on credit-credit usually provided by the very countries whose companies stand to gain.
Furthermore, when new technology is introduced there is often too low a level of expertise to exploit it for native development. This means that while local elites, foreign communities and subsidiaries of transitional corporations may benefit, those lives depend on access to the information are denied it.
21.	From the passage we know that the development of high technology is in the interests of ________.
A) the rich countries
B) scientific development
C) the elite
D) the world economy
22.	It can be inferred from the passage that ________.
A) international trade should be expanded
B) the interests of the poor countries have not been given enough consideration
C) the exports of the poor countries should be increased
D) communications technology in the developing countries should be modernized
23.	Why does the author say that the electronic economy may have a destructive impact on developing countries?
A) Because it enables the developed countries to control the international market.
B) Because it destroys the economic balance of the poor countries.
C) Because it violates the national boundaries of the poor countries.
D) Because it inhibits the industrial growth of developing countries.
24.	The development of modern communications technology in developing countries may ________.
A) hinder their industrial production
B) cause them to lose control of their trade
C) force them to reduce their share of exports
D) cost them their economic independence
25.	The author’s attitude toward the communications revolution is ________.
A) positive
B) critical
C) indifferent
D) tolerant
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
The estimates of the numbers of home-schooled children vary widely. The U.S. Department of Education estimates there are 250,000 to 35,000 home-schooled children in the country. Hone-school advocates put the number much higher-at about a million.
Many public school advocates take a harsh attitude toward home schoolers, perceiving their actions as the ultimate slap in the face for public education and a damaging move for the children. Home schoolers harbor few kind words for public schools, charging shortcomings that range from lack of religious perspective in the curriculum to a herd-like approach to teaching children.
Yet, as public school officials realize they stand little to gain by remaining hostile to the home-school population, and as home schoolers realize they can reap benefits from public schools, these hard lines seem to be softening a bit. Public schoolers have moved closer to tolerance and, in some cases, even cooperation.
Says John Marshall, an education official, “We are becoming relatively tolerant of home schoolers. “The idea is, ‘Let’s give the kids access to public school so they’ll see it’s not as terrible as they’ve been told, and they’ll want to come back.
Perhaps, but don’t count on it, say home-school advocates. Home schoolers, oppose the system because they have strong convictions that their approach to education-whether fueled by religious enthusiasm or the individual child’s interests and natural pace-is best.
“The bulk of home schoolers just want to be left alone,” says Enge Cannon, associate director of the National Center For Home Education. She says home schoolers choose that path for a variety of reasons, but religion plays a role 85 percent of the time.
Professor Van Galen breaks home schoolers into two groups. Some home schoolers want their children to learn not only traditional subject matter but also “strict religious doctrine and a conservative political and social perspective. Not incidentally, they also want their children to learn-both intellectually and emotionally-that the family is the most important institution in society. “
Other home schoolers contend “not so much that the schools teach heresy (异端邪说), but that schools teach whatever they teach inappropriately,” Van Galen writes. “These parents are highly independent and strive to ‘take responsibility’ for their own lives within a society that they define as bureaucratic and inefficient.”
26.	According to the passage, home schoolers are ________.
A) those who engage private teachers to provide additional education for their children
B) those who educate their children at home instead of sending them to school
C) those who advocate combining public education with home schooling
D) those who don’t go to school but are educated at home by their parents
27.	Public schools are softening their position on home schooling because ________.
A) there isn’t much they can go to change the present situation
B) they want to show their tolerance for different situation
C) home schooling provides a new variety of education for children
D) public schools have so many problems that they cannot offer proper education for all children
28.	Home-school advocates are of the opinion that ________.
A) things in public schools are not so bad as has often been said
B) their tolerance of public education will attract more kids to public schools
C) home schooling is superior and, therefore, they will not easily give in
D) their increased cooperation with public school will bring about the improvement of public education
29.	Most home schoolers’ opposition to public education stems from their ________.
A) respect for the interest of individuals
B) worry about the inefficiency of public schools
C) concern with the cost involved
D) devotion to religion
30.	According to Van Galen some home schoolers believe that ________.
A) public schools take up a herd-like approach to teaching children
B) teachers in public school are not as responsible as they should be
C) public schools cannot provide an education that is good enough for their children
D) public schools are the source of bureaucracy and inefficiency in modern society
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Every year television stations receive hundreds of complaints about the loudness of advertisements. However, federal rules forbid the practice of making ads louder than the programming. In addition, television stations always operate at the highest sound level allowed for reasons of efficiency. According to one NBC executive, no difference exists in the peak sound level of ads and programming. Given this information why do commercials sound so loud?
The sensation of sound involves a variety of factors in addition to its speak level. Advertisers are skilful at creating the impression of loudness through their expert use of such factors. One major contributor to the perceived loudness of commercials is that mush less variation in sound level occurs during a commercial. In regular programming the intensity of sound varies over a large range. However, sound levels in commercials tend to stay at or near peak levels.
Other “tricks of the trade” are also used. Because low-frequency sounds can mask higher frequency sounds, advertisers filter out any noises that may drown out the primary message. In addition, the human voice has more auditory (听觉的) impact in the middle frequency ranges. Advertisers electronically vary voice sounds so that they stay within such a frequency band. Another approach is to write the script so that lots of consonants (辅音) are used, because people are more aware of consonants than vowel (元音) sounds. Finally, advertisers try to begin commercials with sounds that are highly different from those of the programming within which the commercial is buried. Because people become adapted to the type of sounds coming from programming, a dramatic change in sound quality draws viewer a attention. For example, notice how many commercials begin with a cheerful song of some type.
The attention-getting property of commercials can be seen by observing one-to two-year-old children who happen to be playing around a television set. They may totally ignore the programming. However, when a commercial comes on, their attention is immediately drawn to it because of its dramatic sound quality.
31.	According to the passage, the maximum intensity of sound coming from commercials ________.
A) does not exceed that of programs
B) is greater than that of programs
C) varies over a large range than that of programs
D) is less than that of programs
32.	Commercials create the sensation of loudness because ________.
A) TV stations always operate at the highest sound levels
B) their sound levels are kept around peak levels
C) their sound levels are kept in the middle frequency ranges
D) unlike regular programs their intensity of sound varies over a wide range
33.	Many commercials begin with a cheerful song of some kind because ________.
A) pop songs attract viewer attention
B) it can increase their loudness
C) advertisers want to make them sound different from regular programs
D) advertisers want to merge music with commercials
34.	One of the reasons why commercials are able to attract viewer attention is that ________.
A) the human voices in commercials have more auditory impact
B) people like cheerful songs that change dramatically in sound quality
C) high-frequency sounds are used to mask sounds that drown out the primary message
D) they possess sound qualities that make the viewer feel that something unusual is happening
35.	In the passage, the author is trying to tell us ________.
A) how TV ads vary vocal sounds to attract attention
B) how the loudness of TV ads is overcome
C) how advertisers control the sound properties of TV ads
D) how the attention-getting properties of sounds are made use of in TV ads
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In the United States, the need to protect plant and animal species has become a highly controversial and sharply political issue since the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973. The act, designed to protect species’ living areas, and policies that preserve land and forests compete with economic interests. In the 1990’s, for example, the woodcutters in the Western United States were challenged legally in their attempt to cut trees for timber in the Cascade Mountains. The challenge was mounted to protect the endangered spotted owl (猫头鹰), whose remaining population occupies these forests and requires the intact, ancient forest for survival. The problematic situation set the interests of environmentalists against those of corporations and of individuals who stood to lose jobs. After months of debate and legal battles, the fate of the woodcutters-and the owls-was still undecided in mid-1992.
Similar tensions exist between the developed and the developing nations. Many people in industrialized nations, for example, believe that developing nations in tropical regions should do more to protect their rain forests and other natural areas. But the developing countries may be impoverished (使穷困), with populations growing so rapidly that using the land is a means to temporarily avoid worsening poverty and starvation.
Many of the changes to Earth that concern scientists have the potential to rob the planet of its biological richness. The destruction of Earth’s ozone layer (臭氧层), for example, could contribute to the general process of impoverishment by allowing ultra-violet rays to harm plants and animals. And global warming could wipe out species unable to quickly adapt to changing climates. Clearly, protecting will come only through coordinated international efforts to control human population, stabilize the composition of the atmosphere, and preserve intact Earth’s complex web life.
36.	Why does the author say that the protection of endangered species is a highly controversial issue?
A) Because people can’t agree as to what species to protect.
B) Because it is difficult to find an effective way to protect such species.
C) Because it affects the interests of certain groups of people.
D) Because it is a major problem involving a series of legal procedures.
37.	According to the passage, the preservation of rain forests ________.
A) may hamper a developing country in its fight against poverty
B) benefits developed countries rather than developing countries
C) should take priority over the control of human population
D) will help improve the living conditions in developing countries
38.	According to the passage, cutting tress to grow more food ________.
A) will widen the gap between the developed and the developing countries
B) is but a short-term relief to the food problem
C) can hardly alleviate the shortage of food
D) proves to be an effective way out for impoverished nations
39.	Among “humanity’s current problems” (Line 6, Para. 3), the chief concern of the scientists is ________.
A) the impoverishment of developing countries
B) the explosion of the human population
C) the reduction of biological diversity
D) the effect of global warming
40.	The author’s purpose in writing this passage is ________.
A) to describe the difficulties in solving humanity’s current problems
B) to present the different views on humanity’s current problems
C) to analyze the contradiction between countries in dealing with humanity’s current problems

Part IV Short Answer Questions (15 minutes)
Directions:	In this part there is a short passage with five questions or incomplete statements. Read the Passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest Possible words (not exceeding 10 words)
Most Americans spend far more of their leisure time with the mass media than in any other occupation. In addition, most of us hear, see, or read some of the media while engaged in other activities. Thus an extremely large number of our waking hours are spent with the mass media. Of all the media, television is clearly dominant, with newspapers a close second, at least as a source of news and other information. Our exposure to all media is important, however, because all of them contribute materials for the construction of that world in our heads. For most people, increased use of one medium does not decrease use of another. In fact, in certain cases, and especially for certain purposes, the more one uses one medium, the more likely one is to use others.
There are various factors that can cause you to expose yourself to the media selectively, avoiding much of the material with which you disagree. Some of that selective exposure is probably due to the psychological pressure you feel to avoid the discomfort caused by confrontation with facts and ideas contrary to your beliefs, attitudes, or behavior. However, some selective exposure is not due to the pressure for consistency but to other factors, such as your age, education, and even the area in which you live and the people with whom you associate.
Quite a different sort of factor that affects your media experiences is the social context of exposure: whether you are alone or with others when you are exposed to a medium; whether you are at home, at the office, in a theater, and soon. These contexts are as much as a potential part of the message you will form as film images on the screen or words on the page. In addition, that social context affects—both directly and indirectly—the media and the media content to which you become exposed. New friends or colleagues get you interested in different things. Other members of the family often select media content that you would not have selected, and you become exposed to it.
There various factors have so much influence on your media exposure that so little of that exposure is planned.
Questions: (注意: 答题尽量简短，超过10个词要扣分。每条横线限写一个英语单词，标点符号不占格。)
S1.	Exposure to all media is important and people sometimes tend to use more media if ________.
S2.	Why are newspapers considered as an important medium according to passage?
S3.	For one reason or another, people’s exposure to the media is often ________.
S4.	Apart from personal preferences, what determines one’s choice of the media and media content?
S5.	The last sentence of the passage indicates that one’s exposure to the media is ________.

Passage One
It’s 8 o’clock on Tuesday, May 1st. Here is the news: Between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00 P.M. last night, five thieves broke into the country house of Lord and Lady Chest-field on an island. They entered by a window at the rear of the house and surprised the owners who were watching television in the drawing room. After disconnection the telephone and tying up Lord and Lady Chest-field, the thieves escaped with 16 precious paintings. The market value of such art works has been estimated at somewhere around 4 million pounds. Lord and Lady Chest-field were not seriously harmed but have been treated for shock in the hospital. Early this morning a woman with a Scottish accent telephoned the Thames in London to say that the Chest-field Organization for Freedom claim the responsibility for the theft. This is the third time this year that this organization has claimed the responsibility for an act of this kind. The organization defends all the farmers on the island. The farmers were forced to leave their lands when Lord Chest-field, their landlord, refused to renew their traditional lease last year in order to extend the reservation area for birds.

Passage Two
A deadly infectious outbreak swept through a small city in Zaire, Africa last spring, killing more than one hundred people. The killer was a rare virus that caused most victims to bleed to death. As scientists rushed to control the outbreak, people in the U. S wondered “Could it attack here?” “We are foolish if we think it couldn’t come to our country.” say doctors. The virus can be highly infectious. If you come in contact with a victim’s blood or other body fluids, you can get sick, too. All it takes is one infected person to start such a disease. That’s what scientists believe has happened in Zaire. The healthcare workers who treated the first victims there soon fell ill too. The problem was they had no protective equipment to prevent themselves from being infected. International rescue workers brought equipment to Zaire soon after the out break occurred. Now the disease appears to be under control. One big mystery is that no one knows where the virus comes from or where it wills strike next. Some scientists say that the virus lies inactive in the cells of some kind of plant, insect or other animals. Then it somehow finds a way to infect humans. Scientists are now headed into the jungles of Africa to find out where the virus lives. Once they find the virus, they also hope to find ways to come about it.
Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
15.	How does the disease mentioned in the passage spread?
16.	What happened to most of the victims stroke with this disease?
17.	Why are the scientists going to the African jungles?
Passage Three
A team of scientists recently began a project to measure the effects of loud noises on sea animals. If the sounds don’t harm the animals, then the researchers can go ahead with a plan to transmit sound waves through the Pacific Ocean to take earth’s temperature. Sound travels faster through warm water than cold water. By analyzing the speed of sound through the ocean over a time, the scientists will be able to determine if our planet is warming up. The experiment was nearly cancelled more than a year ago because environmental groups feared that the sound will confuse or harm the sea-animals. So, scientists are conducting tests on the animals first. The researchers lowered a loud speaker that emits low frequency sound about 1000 meters beneath the ocean. Scientists at the site transmit sound waves into the ocean. Radio transmitters attached to some of the sea-animals help the researches keep track of the animals’ movements. If sea-animals are distressed by the sounds, they would swim away from the speakers. So far, there aren’t any signs that the animals are being harmed. Researchers at the site noticed that large numbers of sea-animals swim near the speaker whether it was turned on or off, but it is still too soon to know for sure, the scientists admit. The test will continue through September. “If all goes well,” they say, we can begin measuring temperature changes on our planet.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	What is the purpose of analyzing the speed of sound through the Pacific Ocean?
19.	What was the reaction of the sea-animals to the sound tests?
20.	For what purpose were radio transmitters used?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them the re are four choices marked A)，B), C), and D). You should deicide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Many Americans harbour a grossly distorted and exaggerated view of most of the risks surrounding food. Fergus Clydesdale, head of the department of food science and nutrition at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, says bluntly that if the dangers from bacterially contaminated chicken were as great as some people believe, “the streets would be littered with people lying here and there.”
Though the public increasingly demands no-risk food, there is no such thing. Bruce Ames, chairman of the biochemistry department at the University of California, Berkeley, points out that up to 10% of a plant’s weight is made up of natural pesticides (杀虫剂). Says he: “Since plants do not have jaws or teeth to protect themselves, they employ chemical warfare.” And many naturally produced chemicals, though occurring in tiny amounts, prove in laboratory tests to be strong carcinogens-a substance which can cause cancer. Mushrooms (磨菇) might be banned if they were judged by the same standards that apply to food additives (添加剂). Declares Christina Stark, a nutritionist at Cornell University: “We’ve got fat worse natural chemicals in the food supply than anything man-made.”
Yet the issues are not that simple. While Americans have no reason to be terrified to sit down at the dinner table, they have every reason to demand significant improvements in food and water safety. They unconsciously and unwillingly take in too much of too many dangerous chemicals. If food already contains natural carcinogens, it does not make much sense to add dozens of new man-made ones. Though most people will withstand the small amounts of contaminants generally found in food and water, at least a few individuals will probably get cancer one day be cause of what they eat and drink.
To make good food and water supplies even better, the Government needs to tighten its regulatory standards, stiffen its inspection program and strengthen its enforcement policies. The food industry should modify some long-accepted practices or turn to less hazardous alternatives. Perhaps most important, consumers will have to do a better job of learning how to handle and cook food properly. The problems that need to be tackled exist all along the food-supply chain, from fields to processing plants to kitchens.
21.	What does the author think of the Americans’ view of their food?
A) They overstate the government’s interference with the food industry.
B) They are overoptimistic about the safety of their food.
C) They overestimate the hazards of their food.
D) They overlook the risks of the food they eat.
22.	The author considers it impossible to obtain no-risk food because ________.
A) no food is free from pollution in the environment
B) pesticides are widely used in agriculture
C) many vegetables contain dangerous natural chemicals
D) almost all foods have additives
23.	By saying “they employ chemical warfare” (Line 4, Para. 2), Bruce Ames means “________”.
A) plants produce certain chemicals to combat pests and diseases
B) plants absorb useful chemicals to promote their growth
C) farmers use man-made chemicals to dissolve the natural chemicals in plants
D) farmers use chemicals to protect plants against pests and diseases
24.	The reduction of the possible hazards in food ultimately depends on ________.
A) the government
B) the consumer
C) the processor
D) the grower
25.	What is the message the author wants to convey in the passage?
A) Eating and drinking have become more hazardous than before.
B) Immediate measures must be taken to improve food production and processing.
C) Health food is not a dream in modern society.
D) There is reason for caution but no cause for alarm with regard to food consumption.
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
There are some each phenomena you can count on, but the magnetic field, someday is not of them. It fluctuates in strength, drifts from its axis, and every few 100,000 years undergo, dramatic polarity reversal-a period when North Pole becomes South Pole and South Pole becomes North Pole. But how is the field generated, and why is it so unstable?
Groundbreaking research by two French geophysicists promises to shed some light on the mystery. Using 80 metres of deep sea sediment (沉淀物) core, they have obtained measurements lots of magnetic-field intensity that span 11 polarity reversals and four million years. The analysis reveals that intensity appears to fluctuate with a clear, well-defined rhythm. Although the strength of the magnetic field varies irregularly during the short term, there seems to be an inevitable long-term decline preceding each polarity reversal. When the poles flip—a process that takes several hundred thousand years-the magnetic field rapidly regains its strength and the cycle is repeated.
The results have caused a stir among geophysicists. The magnetic field is thought to originate from molten (熔化的) iron in the outer core, 3,000 kilometers beneath the earth’s surface. By studying mineral grains found in material ranging from rocks to clay articles, previous researchers have already been able to identify reversals dating back 170 million years, including the most recent switch 730,000 years ago. How and why they occur, however, has been widely debated. Several theories link polarity flips to external disasters such as meteor (陨星) impacts. But Peter Olson, a geophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, says this is unlikely if the French researchers are right. In fact, Olson says intensity that predictably declines from one reversal to the next contradicts 90 percent of the models currently under study. If the results prove to be valid geophysicists will have a new theory to guide them in their quest to understand the earth’s inner physics. It certainly points the direction for future research.
26.	Which of the following titles is most appropriate to the passage?
A) Polarity Reversal: A Fantastic Phenomenon of Nature.
B) Measurement of the Earth’s Magnetic-Field Intensity.
C) Formation of the Two Poles of the Earth.
D) A New Approach to the Study or Geophysics.
27.	The word “flip” (Line 6, Para. 2) most probably means “________”.
A) decline
B) intensify
C) fluctuate
D) reverse
28.	What have the two French geophysicists discovered in their research?
A) Some regularity in the changes of the earth’s magnetic field.
B) Some causes of the fluctuation of the earth’s magnetic field.
C) The origin of the earth’s magnetic field.
D) The frequency of polarity reversals.
29.	The French geophysicists’ study is different from currently prevailing theories in ________.
A) its identification of the origin of the earth’s magnetic field
B) the way the earth’s magnetic intensity is measured
C) its explanation of the shift in the earth’s polarity

A) is likely to direct further research in the inner physics of the earth
B) has successfully solved the mystery of polarity reversals
C) is certain to help predict external disasters
D) has caused great confusion among the world’s geophysicists
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Imagine a world in which there was suddenly no emotion-a world in which human beings could feel no love or happiness, no terror or hate. Try to imagine the consequences of such a transformation. People might not be able to stay alive: knowing neither joy nor pleasure, anxiety nor fear, they would be as likely to repeat acts that hurt them as acts that were beneficial. They could not learn: they could not benefit from experience because this emotionless world would lack rewards and punishments. Society would soon disappear: people would be as likely to harm one another as to provide help and support. Human relationships would not exist: in a world without friends or enemies, there could be no marriage, affection among companions, or bonds among members of groups. Society’s economic underpinnings (支柱) would be destroyed: since earning $10 million would be no more pleasant than earning $10, there would be no incentive to work. In fact, there would be no incentives of any kind. For as we will see, incentives imply a capacity to enjoy them.
In such a world, the chances that the human species would survive are next to zero, because emotions are the basic instrument of our survival and adaptation. Emotions structure the world for us in important ways. As individuals, we categorize objects on the basis of our emotions. True we consider the length, shape, size, or texture, but an object’s physical aspects are less important than what it has done or can do to us—hurt us, surprise us, anger us or make us joyful. We al so use categorizations colored by emotions in our families, communities, and overall society. Out of our emotional experiences with objects and events comes a social feeling of agreement that certain things and actions are good and others are bad, and we apply these categories to every aspect of our social life—from what foods we eat and what clothes we wear to how we keep promises and which people our group will accept. In fact, society exploits our emotional reactions and attitudes, such as loyalty morality, pride shame, guilt, fear and greed, in order to maintain itself It gives high rewards to individuals who perform important tasks such as surgery, makes heroes out of individuals for unusual or dangerous achievements such as flying fighter planes in a war, and uses the legal penal (刑法的) system to make people afraid to engage in antisocial acts.
31.	The reason why people might not be able to stay alive in a world without emotion is that ________.
A) they would not be able to tell the texture of objects
B) they would not know what was beneficial and what was harmful to them
C) they would not be happy with a life without love
D) they would do things that hurt each other’s feelings
32.	According to the passage, people’s learning activities are possible because they ________.
A) believe that emotions are fundamental for them to stay alive
B) benefit from providing help and support to one another
C) enjoy being rewarded for doing the right thing
D) know what is vital to the progress of society
33.	It can be inferred from the passage that the economic foundation of society is dependent on ________.
A) the ability to make money
B) the will to work for pleasure
C) the capacity to enjoy incentives
D) the categorizations of our emotional experiences
34.	Emotions are significant for man’s survival and adaptation because ________.
A) they provide the means by which people view the size or shape of objects
B) they are the basis for the social feeling of agreement by which society is maintained
C) they encourage people to perform dangerous achievements
D) they generate more love than hate among people
35.	The emotional aspects of an object are more important than its physical aspects in that they ________.
A) help society exploit its members for profit
B) encourage us to perform important tasks
C) help to perfect the legal and penal system
D) help us adapt our behavior to the world surrounding us
Questions 36 to 40 based on the following passage:
The Carnegie Foundation report says that many colleges have tried to be “all things to all people”. In doing so, they have increasingly catered to a narrow minded careerism while failing to cultivate a global vision among their students. The current crisis, it contends, does not derive from a legitimate desire to put learning to productive ends. The problem is that in too many academic fields, the work has no context; skills, rather than being means, have become ends. Students are offered a variety of options and allowed to pick their way to a degree. In short, driven by careerism, “the nation’s colleges and universities are more successful in providing credentials (文凭) than in providing a quality education for their students. “The report concludes that the special challenge confronting the undergraduate college is one of shaping an integrated core of common learning. Such a core would introduce students to essential knowledge, to connections across the disciplines, and in the end, to application of knowledge to life beyond the campus. “
Although the key to a good college is a high-quality faculty, the Carnegie study found that most colleges do very little to encourage good teaching. In fact, they do much to undermine it. As one professor observed: “Teaching is important, we are told, and yet faculty know that research and publication matter most.” Not surprisingly, over the last twenty years colleges and universities have failed to graduate half of their four-year degree candidates. Faculty members who dedicated themselves to teaching soon discover that they will not be granted tenure (终身任期), promotion, or substantial salary increases. Yet 70 percent of all faculties say their interests lie more in teaching than in research. Additionally, a frequent complaint among young scholars is that “There is pressure to publish, although there is virtually no interest among administrators or colleagues in the content of the publications.”
36.	When a college tries to be “all things to al people” (Lines 1-2, Para. 1) it aims to ________.
A) satisfy the needs of all kinds of students simultaneously
B) focus on training students in various skills
C) encourage students to take as many courses as possible
D) make learning serve academic rather than productive ends
37.	By saying that “in too many academic fields, the work has no context” (Lines 4-5, Pare. 1) the author means that the teaching in these areas ________.
A) ignores the actual situation
B) is not based on the right perspective
C) only focuses on an integrated core of common learning
D) gives priority to the cultivation of a global vision among students
38.	One of the reasons for the current crisis in American colleges and universities is that ________.
A) a narrow vocationalism has come to dominate many colleges
B) students don’t have enough freedom in choosing what they want to learn
C) skills are being taught as a means to an end
D) students are only interested in obtaining credentials
39.	American colleges and universities failed to graduate half of their four-year degree candidates because ________.
A) most of them lack high-quality faculties
B) the interests of most faculty members lie in research
C) there are not enough incentives for students to study hard
D) they attach greater importance to research and publication than to teaching
40.	It can be inferred from the passage that high-quality college education calls for ________.
A) putting academic work in the proper context
B) a commitment to students and effective teaching
C) the practice of putting leaning to productive ends
D) dedication to research in frontier areas of knowledge

Part IV Short Answer Questions (15 minutes)
Directions:	In this part there is a short passage with five questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the fewest possible words (not exceeding 10 words).
Many parents who welcome the idea of turning off the TV and spending more time with the family are still worried that without TV they would constantly be on call as entertainers for their children. They remember thinking up all sorts of things to do when they were kids. But their own kids seem different, less resourceful, somehow. When there’s nothing to do, these parents observe regretfully, their kids seem unable to come up with any thing to do besides turning on the TV.
One father, for example, says. “When I was a kid, we were always thinking up things to do, projects and games. We certainly never complained in an annoying way to our parents, ‘I have nothing to do!’ He compares this with his own children today: “They’re simply lazy. If someone doesn’t entertain them, they’ll happily sit there watching TV all day. “
There is one word for this father’s disappointment: unfair. It is as if he were disappointed in them for not reading Greek though they have never studied the language. He deplores (哀叹) his children’s lack of inventiveness, as if the ability to play were something innate (天生的) that his children are missing. In fact, while the tendency to play is built into the human species, the actual ability to play-to imagine, to invent, to elaborate on reality in a playful way-and the ability to gain fulfillment from it, these are skills that have to learned and developed.
Such disappointment, however, is not only unjust, it is also destructive. Sensing their parents’ disappointment, children come to believe that they are, indeed, lacking something, and that this makes them less worthy of admiration and respect. Giving children the opportunity to develop new resources, to enlarge their horizons and discover the pleasures of doing things on their own is, on the other hand, a way to help children develop a confident feeling about themselves as capable and interesting people.
Questions: (注意: 答题尽量简短，超过10个词要扣分，每条横线限定一个英语单词，标点符号不占格。)
S1.	According to many parents, without TV, their children would like them to ________.

Section B
Passage One
Most people have had a dog or wanted one as their companion at some time in their lives. If you are thinking of buying a dog, however, you should first decide what sort of companion you need and whether the dog is likely to be happy in the surroundings you can provide. Specialist advice is available to help you choose the most suitable breed of dog. But in part, the decision depends on common sense. Most breeds were originally developed to perform specific tasks. So, if you want a dog to protect you or your house, for example, you should choose a breed that has the right size and characteristics You must also be ready to devote a good deal of time to train the dog when it is young and give it the exercise it needs to throughout its life, unless live in the country and can let it run freely. Dogs are demanding pets. Whereas cats identify with the house and so are content if their place there is secure a dog identifies with its master and consequently wants him to show proof of his affection. The best time to buy a baby-dog is when it is between 6 and 8 weeks old so that it can transfer its affection from its mother to its master. If baby dogs have not established a relationship with the human being until they are over three months old, their strong relationship will always be with dogs. They are likely to be too shy when they are brought out into the world to become good pets.
11.	What’s mentioned as a consideration in buying a dog?
12.	Why does the speaker say a dog is a more demanding pet than a cat?
13.	Why is advised to buy baby dogs under three months old?
Passage Two
People in Poland take their pleasure seriously. They like to have an aim even when spending the time which is entirely their own. During the summer, people start work very early in the morning so that they can finish early and enjoy a leisurely afternoon. It is difficult to imagine Polish people going aimlessly for a walk in the country, though they might go to pick wild fruit, to visit a place of historical importance or to walk 20 KM as a training exercise. They are often admired for their immense enjoyment of the arts. All parks are beautifully cared and are for the use and enjoyment of the people. Quite ordinary people will talk with obvious delight about concerts. There is nearly always a crowd at the door of the theatre, asking for returned tickets. People in Poland now have far more leisure time and more money than ever before. It is therefore possible to spend the weekends in many new ways. Many people now have over 20 days holiday a year. This provides an opportunity for holidays in the country or at the seaside.
14.	What is special about the Polish way of spending leisure time?
15.	For what does the author admire the Polish people?
16.	What do we learn from the passage?
Passage Three
What kind of car will we be driving by the year 2010? Rather different from the type we know today. With the next decade bringing greater change than the past 50 years, the people who will be designing the models of tomorrow believe that environmental problems may well accelerate the pace of the car’s development. The vision is that of a machine with 3 wheels instead of 4， electrically-powered environmentally clean and able to drive itself along intelligent roads, equipped with built-in power supplies. Future cars will pick up the fuel during long journeys from a power source built into the road, or stored in small quantities for travelling in the city. Instead of today’s seating arrangement two in front, two or three behind, all facing forward, the 2010 car will have an interior with adults and children in a family circle. This view of future car based on a much more sophisticated road system. Cars will be automatically controlled by a computer. All the driver will have to do is say where to go and the computer will do the rest. It will become impossible for cars to crash into one another. The technology already exists for the car to become a true automobile.
17.	What is the designer’s vision of the cars of tomorrow?
18.	What else does the passage tell us about the future car?
19.	What is the seating arrangement for future cars?
20.	What is the only thing the driver of the future car has to do?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
We sometimes think humans are uniquely vulnerable to anxiety, but stress seems to affect the immune defenses of lower animals too. In one experiment, for example, behavioral immunologist (免疫学家) Mark Laudenslager, at the University of Denver, gave mild electric shocks to 24 rats. Half the animals could switch off the current by turning a wheel in their enclosure, while the other half could mot. The rats in the two groups were paired so that each time one rat turned the wheel it protected both itself and its helpless partner from the shock. Laudenslager found that the immune response was depressed below normal in the helpless rats but not in those that could turn off the electricity. What he has demonstrated, he believes, is that lack of control over an event, not the experience itself, is what weakens the immune system.
Other researchers agree. Jay Weiss, a psychologist at Duke University School of Medicine, has shown that animals who are allowed to control unpleasant stimuli don’t develop sleep disturbances or changes in brain chemistry typical of stressed rats. But if the animals are confronted with situations they have no control over, they later behave passively when faced with experiences they can control. Such findings reinforce psychologists’ suspicions that the experience or perception of helplessness is one of the most harmful factors in depression.
One of the most startling examples of how the mind can alter the immune response was discovered by chance. In 1975 psychologist Robert Ader at the University of Rochester School of Medicine conditioned (使形成条件反射) mice to avoid saccharin (糖精) by simultaneously feeding them the sweetener and injecting them with a drug that while suppressing their immune systems caused stomach upsets. Associating the saccharin with the stomach pains, the mice quickly learned to avoid the sweetener. In order to extinguish this dislike for the sweetener, Ader reexposed the animals to saccharin, this time without the drug, and was astonished to find that those mice that had received the highest amounts of sweetener during their earlier conditioning died. He could only speculate that he had so successfully conditioned the rats that saccharin alone now served to weaken their immune systems enough to kill them.
11.	Laudenslager’s experiment showed that the immune system of those rats who could turn off the electricity ________.
A) was strengthened
B) was not affected
C) was altered
D) was weakened
12.	According to the passage, the experience of helplessness causes rats to ________.
A) try to control unpleasant stimuli
B) turn off the electricity
C) behave passively in controllable situations
D) become abnormally suspicious
13.	The reason why the mice in Ader’s experiment avoided saccharin was that ________.
A) they disliked its taste
B) it affected their immune systems
C) it led to stomach pains
D) they associated it with stomachaches
14.	The passage tells us that the most probable reason for the death of the mice in Ader’s experiment was that ________.
A) they had been weakened psychologically by the saccharin
B) the sweetener was poisonous to them
C) their immune systems had been altered by the mind
D) they had taken too much sweetener during earlier conditioning
15.	It can be concluded from the passage that the immune systems of animals ________.
A) can be weakened by conditioning
B) can be suppressed by drug injections
C) can be affected by frequent doses of saccharin
D) can be altered by electric shocks
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
The destruction of our natural resources and contamination of our food supply continue occur, largely because of the extreme difficulty in affixing (把…固定) legal responsibility on those who continue to treat our environment with reckless abandon (放任). Attempts to prevent pollution by legislation, economic incentives and friendly persuasion have been net by lawsuits, personal and industrial denial and long delays—not only in accepting responsibility, but more importantly, in doing something about it.
It seems that only when government decides it can afford tax incentives or production sacrifices is there any initiative for change. Where is industry’s and our recognition that protecting mankind’s great treasure is the single most important responsibility? If ever there will be time for environmental health professionals to come to the frontlines and provide leadership to solve environmental problems, that time is now.
We are being asked, and, in fact, the public is demanding that we take positive action. It is our responsibility as professionals in environmental health to make the difference. Yes, the ecologists, the environmental activists and the conservationists serve to communicate, stimulate thinking and promote behavioral change. However, it is those of us who are paid to make the decisions to develop, improve and enforce environmental standards, I submit, who must lead the charge.
We must recognize that environmental health issues do not stop at city limits, county lines, state or even federal boundaries. We can no longer afford to be tunnel-visioned in our approach. We must visualize issues from every perspective to make the objective decisions. We must express our views clearly to prevent media distortion and public confusion.
I believe we have a three-part mission for the present. First, we must continue to press for improvements in the quality of life that people can make for themselves. Second, we must investigate and understand the link between environment and health. Third, we must be able to communicate technical information in a form that citizens can understand. If we can accomplish these three goals in this decade, maybe we can finally stop environmental degradation, and not merely hold it back. We will then be able to spend pollution dollars truly on prevention rather than on bandages.
16.	We can infer from the first two paragraphs that the industrialists disregard environmental protection chiefly because ________.
A) they are unaware of the consequences of what they are doing
B) they are reluctant to sacrifice their own economic interests
C) time has not yet come for them to put due emphasis on it
D) it is difficult for them to take effective measures
17.	The main task now facing ecologists, environmental activists and conservationists is ________.
A) to prevent pollution by legislation, economic incentives and persuasion
B) to arouse public awareness of the importance of environmental protection
C) to take radical measures to control environmental pollution
D) to improve the quality of life by enforcing environmental standards
18.	The word “tunnel-visioned (Line 2, Para. 4) most probably means “________”.
A) narrow-minded
B) blind to the facts
C) short-sighted
D) able to see only one aspect
19.	Which of the following, according to the author, should play the leading role in the solution of environmental problems?
A) Legislation and government intervention.
B) The industry’s understanding and support.
C) The efforts of environmental health professionals.
D) The cooperation of ecologists, environmental activists and conservationists.
20.	Which of the following is true according to the last paragraph?
A) Efforts should be exerted on pollution prevention instead of on remedial measures.
B) More money should be spent in order to stop pollution.
C) Ordinary citizens have no access to technical information on pollution.
D) Environmental degradation will be stopped by the end of this decade.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
British universities, groaning under the burden of a huge increase in student numbers, are warning that the tradition of a free education is at risk. The universities have threatened to impose an admission fee on students to plug a gap in revenue if the government does not act to improve their finances and scrap some public spending cutbacks.
The government responded to the universities’ threat by setting up the most fundamental review of higher education for a generation, under a non-party troubleshooter (调停人)，Sir Ron Dearing.
One in three school-leavers enters higher education, five times the number when the last review took place thirty years ago.
Everyone agrees a system that is feeling the strain after rapid expansion needs a lot more money-but there is little hope of getting it from the taxpayer and not much scope for attracting more finance from business.
Most colleges believe students should contribute to tuition costs, something that is common elsewhere in the world but would mark a revolutionary change in Britain. Universities want the government to introduce a loan scheme for tuition fees and have suspended their own threatened action for now. They await Dearing’s advice, hoping it will not be too late-some are already reported to be in financial difficulty.
As the century nears its end, the whole concept of what a university should be is under the microscope. Experts ponder how much they can use computers instead of classrooms, talk of the need for lifelong learning and refer to students as “consumers.”
The Confederation (联盟) of British Industry, the key employers’ organization, wants even more expansion in higher education to help fight competition on world markets from booming Asian economies. But the government has doubts about more expansion. The Times newspaper egress, complaining that quality has suffered as student numbers soared, with close tutorial supervision giving way to “mass production methods more typical of European universities.”
21.	The chief concern of British universities is ________.
A) how to tackle their present financial difficulty
B) how to expand the enrollment to meet the needs of enterprises
C) how to improve their educational technology
D) how to put an end to the current tendency of quality deterioration
22.	We can learn from the passage that in Britain ________.
A) the government pays dearly for its financial policy
B) universities are mainly funded by businesses
C) higher education is provided free of charge
D) students are ready to accept loan schemes for tuition
23.	What was the percentage of high school graduates admitted to universities in Britain thirty years ago?
A) 20% or so.
B) About 15%.
C) Above 30%.
D) Below 10%.
24.	It can be inferred from the passage that ________.
A) the British government will be forced to increase its spending on higher education
B) British employers demand an expansion in enrollment at the expense of quality
C) the best way out for British universities is to follow their European counterparts
D) British students will probably have to pay for their higher education in the near future
25.	Which of the following is the viewpoint of the Times newspaper?
A) Expansion in enrollment is bound to affect the quality of British higher education.
B) British universities should expand their enrollment to meet the needs of industry.
C) European universities can better meet the needs of the modern world.
D) British universities should help fight competition on world markets.
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:
There’s simple premise behind what Larry Myers does for a living: If you can smell it, you can find it.
Myers is the founder of Auburn University’s Institute for Biological Detection Systems, the main task of which is to chase the ultimate in detection devices—an artificial nose.
For now, the subject of their research is little more than a stack of gleaming chips tucked away in a laboratory drawer. But soon, such a tool could be hanging from the belts of police, arson (纵火) investigators and food-safety inspectors.
The technology that they are working in would suggest quite reasonably that, within three to five years, we’ll have some workable sensors ready to use. Such devices might find wide use in places that attract terrorists. Police could detect drugs, bodies and bombs hidden in cars, while food inspectors could easily test food and water for contamination.
The implications for revolutionary advances in public safety and the food industry are astonishing. But so, too, are the possibilities for abuse; Such machines could determine whether a woman is ovulating (排卵), without a physical exam-or even her knowledge.
One of the traditional protectors of American liberty is that is has been impossible to search everyone. That’s getting not to be the case.
Artificial biosensors created at Auburn work totally differently from anything ever seen before. Aroma Scan, for example, is a desktop machine based on a bank of chips sensitive to specific chemicals that evaporate into the air. As air is sucked into the machine, chemicals pass over the sensor surfaces and produce changes in the electrical current flowing through them. Those current changes are logged into a computer that sorts out odors based on their electrical signatures.
Myers says they expect to load a single fingernail-size chip with thousands of odor receptors (感受器)， enough to create a sensor that’s nearly as sensitive as a dog’s nose.
26.	Which of the following is within the capacity of the artificial nose being developed?
A) Performing physical examinations.
B) Locating places which attract terrorists.
C) Detecting drugs and water contamination.
D) Monitoring food processing.
27.	A potential problem which might be caused by the use of an artificial nose is ________.
A) negligence of public safety
B) an abuse of personal freedom
C) a hazard to physical health
D) a threat to individual privacy
28.	The word “logged“ (Line 5, Para. 7) most probably means”________ “.
A) preset
B) entered
C) processed
D) simulated
29.	To produce artificial noses for practical use, it is essential ________.
A) to develop microchips with thousands of odor receptors
B) to invent chips sensitive to various chemicals
C) to design a computer program to sort out smells
D) to find chemicals that can alter the electrical current passing through
30.	The author’s attitude towards Larry Myers’ works is ________.
A) cautious
B) approving
C) suspicious
D) overenthusiastic

Reading electively or extensively?
Knowledge is power. Everybody knows it. The main way for us students to gain knowledge is from the books. So some students argue that we should read extensively in order to know something about everything, thus broadening our knowledge and enriching experience.
As books are of different kinds and have different content, so some students argue that we should read selectively, that is to read those book which are of benefits both to our mind and body and dismiss those which are of no good to us.
As far as I am concerned, I think we should selectively do extensive reading. Knowledge is limitless while life is short. So we should make full use of our time to do the most effective reading and make the greatest to our motherland.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line trough the centre. Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows.
Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of “trash talk (废话)”. The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society’s moral catastrophes (灾难), yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments (困境) of other people’s lives.
Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual’s quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.
Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a “final word”. He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show’s main target audiences are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and stability to deal with life’s tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18-to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show’s exploitation.
While the two shows are as different as night and day, both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.
21.	Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are ________.
A) more family-oriented
B) unusually popular
C) more profound
D) relatively formal
22.	Though the social problems Jerry Springer talks about appear distasteful, the audience ________.
A) remain fascinated by them
B) are ready to face up to them
C) remain indifferent to them
D) are willing to get involved in them
23.	Which of the following is likely to be a topic of the Oprah Winfrey show?
A) A new type of robot.
B) Racist hatred.
C) Family budget planning.
D) Street violence.
24.	Despite their different approaches, the two talk shows are both ________.
A) ironical
B) sensitive
C) instructive
D) cynical
25.	We can learn from the passage that the two talk shows ________.
A) have monopolized the talk show circuit
B) exploit the weaknesses in human nature
C) appear at different times of the day
D) are targeted at different audiences
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
To understand the marketing concept, it is only necessary to understand the difference between marketing and selling. Not too many years ago, most industries concentrated primarily on the efficient production of goods, and then relied on “persuasive salesmanship” to move as much of these goods as possible. Such production and selling focuses on the needs of the seller to produce goods and then convert them into money.
Marketing, on the other hand, focuses on the wants of consumers. It begins with first analyzing the preferences and demands of consumers and then producing goods that will satisfy them. This eye-on-the-consumer approach is known as the marketing concept, which simply means that instead of trying to sell whatever is easiest to produce or buy for resale, the makers and dealers first endeavor to find out what the consumer wants to buy and then go about making it available for purchase.
This concept does not imply that business is benevolent (慈善的) or that consumer satisfaction is given priority over profit in a company. There are always two sides to every business transaction-the firm and the customer-and each must be satisfied before trade occurs. Successful merchants and producers, however, recognize that the surest route to profit is through understanding and catering to customers. A striking example of the importance of catering to the consumer presented itself in mid-1985, when Coca Cola changed the flavor of its drink. The non-acceptance of the new flavor by a significant portion of the public brought about a prompt restoration of the Classic Coke, which was then marketed alongside the new. King Customer ruled!
26.	The marketing concept discussed in the passage is, in essence, ________.
A) the practice of turning goods into money
B) making goods available for purchase
C) the customer-centred approach
D) a form of persuasive salesmanship
27.	What was the main concern of industrialists before the marketing concept was widely accepted?
A) The needs of the market.
B) The efficiency of production.
C) The satisfaction of the user.
D) The preferences of the dealer.
28.	According to the passage, “to move as much of these goods as possible” (Lines 3-4, Para. 1) means “________”.
A) to sell the largest possible amount of goods
B) to transport goods as efficiently as possible
C) to dispose of these goods in large quantities
D) to redesign these goods for large-scale production
29.	What does the restoration of the Classic Coke best illustrate?
A) Traditional goods have a stronger appeal to the majority of people.
B) It takes time for a new product to be accepted by the public.
C) Consumers with conservative tastes are often difficult to please.
D) Products must be designed to suit the taste of the consumer.
30.	In discussing the marketing concept, the author focuses on ________.
A) its main characteristic
B) its social impact
C) its possible consequence
D) its theoretical basis
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Conventional wisdom about conflict seems pretty much cut and dried. Too little conflict breeds apathy (冷漠) and stagnation (呆滞). Too much conflict leads to divisiveness (分裂) and hostility. Moderate levels of conflict, however, can spark creativity and motivate people in a healthy and competitive way.
Recent research by Professor Charles R. Schwenk, however, suggests that the optimal level of conflict may be more complex to determine than these simple generalizations. He studied perceptions of conflict among a sample of executives. Some of the executives worked for profit-seeking organizations and others for not-for-profit organizations.
Somewhat surprisingly, Schwenk found that opinions about conflict varied systematically as a function of the type of organization. Specifically, managers in not-for-profit organizations strongly believed that conflict was beneficial to their organizations and that it promoted higher quality decision making than might be achieved in the absence of conflict.
Managers of for-profit organizations saw a different picture. They believed that conflict generally was damaging and usually led to poor-quality decision making in their organizations. Schwenk interpreted these results in terms of the criteria for effective decision making suggested by the executives. In the profit-seeking organizations, decision-making effectiveness was most often assessed in financial terms. The executives believed that consensus rather than conflict enhanced financial indicators.
In the not-for-profit organizations, decision-making effectiveness was defined from the perspective of satisfying constituents. Given the complexities and ambiguities associated with satisfying many diverse constituents executives perceived that conflict led to more considered and acceptable decisions.
31.	In the eyes of the author, conventional opinion on conflict is ________.
A) wrong
B) oversimplified
C) misleading
D) unclear
32.	Professor Charles R. Schwenk’s research shows ________.
A) the advantages and disadvantages of conflict
B) the real value of conflict
C) the difficulty in determining the optimal level of conflict
D) the complexity of defining the roles of conflict
33.	We can learn from Schwenk’s research that ________.
A) a person’s view of conflict is influenced by the purpose of his organization
B) conflict is necessary for managers of for-profit organizations
C) different people resolve conflicts in different ways
D) it is impossible for people to avoid conflict
34.	The passage suggests that in for-profit organizations ________.
A) there is no end of conflict
B) expression of different opinions is encouraged
C) decisions must be justifiable
D) success lies in general agreement
35.	People working in a not-for-profit organization ________.
A) seem to be difficult to satisfy
B) are free to express diverse opinions
C) are less effective in making decisions
D) find it easier to reach agreement
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Imagine eating everything delicious you want-with none of the fat. That would be great, wouldn’t it?
New “fake fat” products appeared on store shelves in the United States recently, but not everyone is happy about it. Makers of the products, which contain a compound called olestra, say food manufacturers can now eliminate fat from certain foods. Critics, however, say the new compound can rob the body of essential vitamins and nutrients (营养物) and can also cause unpleasant side effects in some people. So it’s up to decide whether the new fat-free products taste good enough to keep eating.
Chemists discovered olestra in the late 1960s, when they were searching for a fat that could be digested by infants more easily. Instead of finding the desired fat, the researchers created a fat that can’t be digested at all.
Normally, special chemicals in the intestines (肠) “grab” molecules of regular fat and break them down so they can be used by the body. A molecule of regular fat is made up of three molecules of substances called fatty acids.
The fatty acids are absorbed by the intestines and bring with them the essential vitamins A, D, E, and K. When fat molecules are present in the intestines with any of those vitamins, the vitamins attach to the molecules and are carried into the bloodstream.
Olestra, which is made from six to eight molecules of fatty acids, is too large for the intestines to absorb. It just slides through the intestines without being broken down. Manufacturers say it’s that ability to slide unchanged through the intestines that makes olestra so valuable as a fat substitute. It provides consumers with the taste of regular fat without any bad effects on the body. But critics say olestra can prevent vitamins A, D, E, and K from being absorbed. It can also prevent the absorption of carotenoids (类胡萝卜素), compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, etc.
Manufacturers are adding vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as carotenoids to their products now. Even so, some nutritionists are still concerned that people might eat unlimited amounts of food made with the fat substitute without worrying about how many calories they are consuming.
36.	We learn from the passage that olestra is a substance that ________.
A) contains plenty of nutrients
B) renders foods calorie-free while retaining their vitamins
C) makes foods easily digestible
D) makes foods fat-free while keeping them delicious
37.	The result of the search for an easily digestible fat turned out to be ________.
A) commercially useless
B) just as anticipated
C) somewhat controversial
D) quite unexpected
38.	Olestra is different from ordinary fats in that ________.
A) it passes through the intestines without being absorbed
B) it facilitates the absorption of vitamins by the body
C) it helps reduce the incidence of heart disease
D) it prevents excessive intake of vitamins
39.	What is a possible negative effect of olestra according to some critics?
A) It may impair the digestive system.
B) It may affect the overall fat intake.
C) It may increase the risk of cancer.
D) It may spoil the consumers’ appetite.
40.	Why are nutritionists concerned about adding vitamins to olestra?
A) It may lead to the over-consumption of vitamins.
B) People may be induced to eat more than is necessary.
C) The function of the intestines may be weakened.
D) It may trigger a new wave of fake food production.

Until the very latest moment of his existence, man has been bound to the planet on which he originated and developed. Now he had the capability to leave that planet (71) and move out into the universe to those worlds which he has known previously only directly. Men have explored parts of (72) the moon, put spaceships in orbit around another planet and possibly within the decade will land into another planet and (73) explore it. Can we be too bold as to suggest that we may be (74) able to colonize other planet within the not—too—distant (75) future? Some have advocated such a procedure as a solution to the population problem. ship the excess people off to the moon. But we must keep in head the billions of dollars we (76) might spend in carrying out the project. To maintain the earth’s population at its present level. we would have to blast off into space 7,500 people every hour of every day of the year.
Why are we spending so little money on space (77) exploration? Consider the great need for improving many (78) aspects of the global environment, one is surely justified in his concern for the money and resources that they are poured (79) into the space exploration efforts. But perhaps we should look at both sides of the coin before arriving hasty (80) conclusions.

How I Finance My College Education
With the rapid development of higher education in China, and more high school graduates admitted, universities can no longer be financed exclusively by the government and students must pay at least partly for their schooling.
There are various ways for a student to pay his tuition and fees. To begin with, if the student is quite excellent in his studies, he can apply for scholarship. Secondly, especially in China, he can always depend on his parents for all kinds of expenditure, including living allowances. Then, he can choose to turn to the bank for a loan to pay his way through university, which he can repay after graduation. If he finds all the above not desirable, he still had another road to take-to do a part-time job and work his way through.
In my case, I am fortunate enough to be born into a well-to-do family and have no difficulty having my parents pay for all my fees. But as a college student, I dislike a totally dependent existence, so I am working part-time as a newspaper-boy to help support myself. And I am also studying hard, hoping to win some scholarship or awards one day so that I can be wholly self-reliant and independent.

Section B
Passage 1
Most people know what a hot dog is. It’s a sausage in a roll. But do you know why it’s called a hot dog? Well, the long red sausage which goes into a hotdog is called a Frankfurter. It got its name from the German town Frankfurt. The sausages were very popular, but hot frankfurters were difficult to sell in crowds. One man, Harry Stevens, had the job of feeding the crowds in baseball games. He had an idea. Why not put the frankfurters in long, hot bread rolls? This made them easy to sell. The “red hot” had a hot and attractive taste and became very popular. But in 1903, an American cartoonist drew a long German sausage dog in place of the frankfurter so a frankfurter in a roll soon became known as a “hot dog”. It was a joke, but some people really thought the sausages contained dog meat. For a while, sales of hotdogs failed, but not for long.
11.	What is a frankfurter?
12.	What was Harry Stevens’ job?
13.	Why did sales of hot dogs decrease for some time?
Passage 2
We all scream for water when thirsty, but do you know in very hot, dry weather, plants also make faint sounds—as if they are crying out for help?
You see, in a plant’s stem there are hundreds of “water pipes” that bring water and minerals from the soil all the way up to the leaves. As the ground turns dry, it becomes harder and harder for the plants to do this.
In severe droughts, plants have to fight to pull out any water available. Scientist Robert winter has found out that when it is really bad their water pipes snap from the tension like rubber bands. When that happens, the whole plant vibrates a little. The snapping pipes make noises ten thousand times more quiet than a whisper.
Robert knows that healthy, well-watered plants are quiet. He also knows that many insects prefer attacking dry plants rather than healthy plants. How do the insects know which are healthy plants and which are not? Robert thinks that the insects may listen for the plants that cry and then they may buzz in to kill.
To test his theory, Robert is using a device that can imitate plant cries. He attaches it to a quiet, healthy plant so the plant sounds thirsty. Then he watches insects to see if they attack more often than usual.
If he is right, scientists could use the insects’ ability against them. They could build traps that imitate crying plants. So when the insects buzz in to eat, they won’t buzz out.
14.	What do plants do when they are thirsty?
15.	What plants do many insects tend to attack?
16.	What could scientists do if Robert’s theory proves to be true?
Passage 3
People enjoy taking trips, but what are the reasons they leave home? One reason is for education. People travel because they want to broaden their horizons to learn about other people and other places. They are curious about other cultures. When people are tourists, they get a quick look at different ways of living. Even a short look at another kind of lifestyle is an important lesson.
On a trip, a person can learn directly—by visiting museums and historic spots. What does a tourist learn who sees the art museums, visits the historical palaces and other scenic spots in Paris, and shops along the River Seine? He gets a vivid picture—a real-life—one of the French people. He learns about their attitudes, how they feel about business, beauty and history.
What about the tourist who goes to Hong Kong? Does he get the same information that he could get from a book? he might read that Hong Kong is crowded, that there is less than 200 square meters of space for each person, but seeing and feeling the lack of space will impress him much more. He might read that there are nearly 200 vehicles for every kilometer of roadway, but the sight of so many vehicles parked along the roadside will be a much more vivid lesson. The tourist to Hong Kong will never forget the contrasts—the straight vertical lines of the tall modern buildings and the moving lines of boats that people live in.
17.	Why do people leave home to travel according to the passage?
18.	What do we learn from the passage about Paris?
19.	What impression will a tourist get of Hong Kong?
20.	What does the passage tell us about travelling?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the 1920s demand for American farm products fell, as European countries began to recover from World War I and instituted austerity (紧缩) programs to reduce their imports. The result was a sharp drop in farm prices. This period was more disastrous for farmers than earlier times had been, because farmers were no longer self-sufficient. They were paying for machinery, seed, and fertilizer, and they were also buying consumer goods. The prices of the items farmers bought remained constant, while prices they received for their products fell. These developments were made worse by the Great Depression, which began in 1929 and extended throughout the 1939s.
In 1929, under President Herbert Hoover, the Federal Farm Board was organized. It established the principle of direct interference with supply and demand, and it represented the first national commitment to provide greater economic stability for farmers.
President Hoover’s successor attached even more importance to this problem. One of the first measures proposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he took office in 1933 was the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which was subsequently passed by Congress. This law gave the Secretary of Agriculture the power to reduce production through voluntary agreements with farmers who were paid to take their land out of use. A deliberate scarcity of farm products was planned in an effort to raise prices. This law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the grounds that general taxes were being collected to pay one special group of people. However, new laws were passed immediately that achieved the same result of resting soil and providing flood-control measures, but which were based on the principle of soil conservation. The Roosevelt Administration believed that rebuilding the nation’s soil was in the national interest and was not simply a plan to help farmers at the expense of other citizens. Later the government guaranteed loans to farmers so that they could buy farm machinery, hybrid (杂交) grain, and fertilizers.
21.	What brought about the decline in the demand for American farm products?
A) The impact of the Great Depression.
B) The shrinking of overseas markets.
C) The destruction caused by the First World War.
D) The increased exports of European countries.
22.	The chief concern of the American government in the area of agriculture in the 1920s was ________.
A) to increase farm production
B) to establish agricultural laws
C) to prevent farmers from going bankrupt
D) to promote the mechanization of agriculture
23.	The Agricultural Adjustment Act encouraged American farmers to ________.
A) reduce their scale of production
B) make full use of their land
C) adjust the prices of their farm products
D) be self-sufficient in agricultural production
24.	The Supreme Court rejected the Agricultural Adjustment Act because it believed that the Act ________.
A) might cause greater scarcity of farm products
B) didn’t give the Secretary of Agriculture enough power
C) would benefit neither the government nor the farmers
D) benefited one group of citizens at the expense of others
25.	It was claimed that the new laws passed during the Roosevelt Administration were aimed at ________.
A) reducing the cost of farming
B) conserving soil in the long-term interest of the nation
C) lowering the burden of farmers
D) helping farmers without shifting the burden onto other taxpayers
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
In the 1950s, the pioneers of artificial intelligence (AI) predicted that, by the end of this century, computers would be conversing with us at work and robots would be performing our housework. But as useful as computers are, they’re nowhere close to achieving anything remotely resembling these early aspirations for humanlike behavior. Never mind something as complex as conversation: the most powerful computers struggle to reliably recognize the shape of an object, the most elementary of tasks for a ten-month-old kid.
A growing group of AI researchers think they know where the field went wrong. The problem, the scientists say, is that AI has been trying to separate the highest, most abstract levels of thought, like language and mathematics, and to duplicate them with logical, step-by-step programs. A new movement in AI, on the other hand, takes a closer look at the more roundabout way in which nature came up with intelligence. Many of these researchers study evolution and natural adaptation instead of formal logic and conventional computer programs. Rather than digital computers and transistors, some want to work with brain cells and proteins. The results of these early efforts are as promising as they are peculiar, and the new nature-based AI movement is slowly but surely moving to the forefront of the field.
Imitating the brain’s neural (神经的) network is a huge step in the right direction, says computer scientist and biophysicist Michael Conrad, but it still misses an important aspect of natural intelligence. “People tend to treat the brain as if it were made up of color-coded transistors”, he explains, “but it’s not simply a clever network of switches. There are lots of important things going on inside the brain cells themselves.” Specifically, Conrad believes that many of the brain’s capabilities stem from the pattern recognition proficiency of the individual molecules that make up each brain cell. The best way to build and artificially intelligent device, he claims, would be to build it around the same sort of molecular skills.
Right now, the option that conventional computers and software are fundamentally incapable of matching the processes that take place in the brain remains controversial. But if it proves true, then the efforts of Conrad and his fellow AI rebels could turn out to be the only game in town.
26.	The author says that the powerful computers of today ________.
A) are capable of reliably recognizing the shape of an object
B) are close to exhibiting humanlike behavior
C) are not very different in their performance from those of the 50’s
D) still cannot communicate with people in a human language
27.	The new trend in artificial intelligence research stems from ________.
A) the shift of the focus of study on to the recognition of the shapes of objects
B) the belief that human intelligence cannot be duplicated with logical, step-by-step programs
C) the aspirations of scientists to duplicate the intelligence of a ten-month-old child
D) the efforts made by scientists in the study of the similarities between transistors and brain cells
28.	Conrad and his group of AI researchers have been making enormous efforts to ________.
A) find a roundabout way to design powerful computers
B) build a computer using a clever network of switches
C) find out how intelligence developed in nature
D) separate the highest and most abstract levels of thought
29.	What’s the author’s opinion about the new AI movement?
A) It has created a sensation among artificial intelligence researchers but will soon die out.
B) It’s a breakthrough in duplicating human thought processes.
C) It’s more like a peculiar game rather than a real scientific effort.
D) It may prove to be in the right direction though nobody is sure of its future prospects.
30.	Which of the following is closest in meaning to the phrase “the only game in town” (Line 3, Para. 4)?
A) The only approach to building an artificially intelligent computer.
B) The only way for them to win a prize in artificial intelligence research.
C) The only area worth studying in computer science.
D) The only game they would like to play in town.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:
Cars account for half the oil consumed in the U.S., about half the urban pollution and one fourth the greenhouse (温室) gases. They take a similar toll of (损耗) resources in other industrial nations and in the cities of the developing world. As vehicle use continues to increase in the coming decade, the U.S. and other countries will have to deal with these issues or else face unacceptable economic, health-related and political costs. It is unlikely that oil prices will remain at their current low level or that other nations will accept a large and growing U.S. contribution to global climatic change.
Policymakers and industry have four options: reduce vehicle use, increase the efficiency and reduce the emissions of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, switch to less harmful fuels, or find less polluting driving systems. The last of these—in particular the introduction of vehicles powered by electricity—is ultimately the only sustainable option. The other alternatives are attractive in theory but in practice are either impractical or offer only marginal improvements. For example, reduced vehicle use could solve traffic problems and a host of social and environmental problems, but evidence from around the world suggests that it is very difficult to make people give up their cars to any significant extent. In the U.S., mass-transit ridership and carpooling (合伙用车) have declined since World War II. Even in Western Europe, with fuel prices averaging more than $1 a liter (about $4 a gallon) and with easily accessible mass transit and dense populations, cars still account for 80 percent of all passenger travel.
Improved energy efficiency is also appealing, but automotive fuel economy has barely made any progress in 10 years. Alternative fuels such as natural gas, burned in internal-combustion engines, could be introduced at relatively low cost, but they would lead to only marginal reductions in pollution and greenhouse emissions (especially because oil companies are already spending billions of dollars every year to develop less polluting types of gasoline).
31.	From the passage we know that the increased use of cars will ________.
A) consume half of the oil produced in the world
B) have serious consequences for the well-being of all nations
C) widen the gap between the developed and developing countries
D) impose an intolerable economic burden on residents of large cities
32.	The U.S. has to deal with the problems arising from vehicle use because ________.
A) most Americans are reluctant to switch to public transportation systems
B) the present level of oil prices is considered unacceptable
C) other countries will protest its increasing greenhouse emissions
D) it should take a lead in conserving natural resources
33.	Which of the following is the best solution to the problems mentioned in the passage?
A) The designing of highly efficient car engines.
B) A reduction of vehicle use in cities.
C) The development of electric cars.
D) The use of less polluting fuels.
34.	Which of the following is practical but only makes a marginal contribution to solving the problem of greenhouse emissions?
A) The use of fuels other than gasoline.
B) Improved energy efficiency.
C) The introduction of less polluting driving systems.
D) Reducing car use by carpooling.
35.	Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?
A) The decline of public transportation accounts for increased car use in Western Europe.
B) Cars are popular in Western Europe even though fuel prices are fairly high.
C) The reduction of vehicle use is the only sustainable option in densely populated Western Europe.
D) Western European oil companies cannot sustain the cost of developing new-type fuels.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Reebok executives do not like to hear their stylish athletic shoes called “footwear for yuppies (雅皮士,少壮高薪职业人士)”. They contend that Reebok shoes appeal to diverse market segments, especially now that the company offers basketball and children’s shoes for the under-18 set and walking shoes for older customers not interested in aerobics (健身操) or running. The executives also point out that through recent acquisitions they have added hiking boots, dress and casual shoes, and high-performance athletic footwear to their product lines, all of which should attract new and varied groups of customers.
Still, despite its emphasis on new markets, Reebok plans few changes in the upmarket (高档消费人群的) retailing network that helped push sales to $1 billion annually, ahead of all other sports shoe marketers. Reebok shoes, which are priced from $27 to $85, will continue to be sold only in better specialty, sporting goods, and department stores, in accordance with the company’s view that consumers judge the quality of the brand by the quality of its distribution.
In the past few years, the Massachusetts-based company has imposed limits on the number of its distributors (and the number of shoes supplied to stores), partly out of necessity. At times the unexpected demand for Reebok’s exceeded supply, and the company could barely keep up with orders from the dealers it already had. These fulfillment problems seem to be under control now, but the company is still selective about its distributors. At present, Reebok shoes are available in about five thousand retail stores in the United States.
Reebok has already anticipated that walking shoes will be the next fitness-related craze, replacing aerobics shoes the same way its brightly colored, soft leather exercise footwear replaced conventional running shoes. Through product diversification and careful market research, Reebok hopes to avoid the distribution problems Nike came across several years ago, when Nike misjudged the strength of the aerobics shoe craze and was forced to unload huge inventories of running shoes through discount stores.
36.	One reason why Reebok’s managerial personnel don’t like their shoes to be called “footwear for yuppies” is that ________.
A) they believe that their shoes are popular with people of different age groups
B) new production lines have been added to produce inexpensive shoes
C) “yuppies” usually evokes a negative image
D) the term makes people think of prohibitive prices
37.	Reebok’s view that “consumers judge the quality of the brand by the quality of its distribution” (Line 5, Para. 2) implies that ________.
A) the quality of a brand is measured by the service quality of the store selling it
B) the quality of a product determines the quality of its distributors
C) the popularity of a brand is determined by the stores that sell it
D) consumers believe that first-rate products are only sold by high-quality stores
38.	Reebok once had to limit the number of its distributors because ________.
A) its supply of products fell short of demand
B) too many distributors would cut into its profits
C) the reduction of distributors could increase its share of the market
D) it wanted to enhance consumer confidence in its products
39.	Although the Reebok Company has solved the problem of fulfilling its orders, it ________.
A) does not want to further expand its retailing network
B) still limits the number of shoes supplied to stores
C) is still particular about who sells its products
D) still carefully chooses the manufacturers of its products
40.	What lesson has Reebok learned from Nike’s distribution problems?
A) A company should not sell its high quality shoes in discount stores.
B) A company should not limit its distribution network.
C) A company should do follow-up surveys of its products.
D) A company should correctly evaluate the impact of a new craze on the market.

When you start talking about good and bad manners you immediately start meeting difficulties. Many people just cannot agree what they mean. We asked a lady, who replied that she thought you could tell a well-mannered person on the way they (71) occupied the space around them—for example, when such a person walks down a street he or she is constantly unaware of (72) others. Such people never bump into other people.
However, a second person thought that this was more a question of civilized behavior as good manners. Instead, this (73) other person told us a story, it he said was quite well known, (74) about an American who had been invited to an Arab meal at (75) one of the countries of the Middle East. The American hasn’t (76) been told very much about the kind of food he might expect. If he had known about American food, he might have behaved (77) better.
Immediately before him was a very flat piece of bread that looked, to him, very much as a napkin (餐巾） Picking it (78) up, he put it into his collar, so that it falls across his shirt. (79)
His Arab host, who had been watching, said of nothing, but (80) immediately copied the action of his guest.
And that, said this second person, was a fine example of good manners.

Part V Writing
Is a Test of spoken English Necessary?
A test of spoken English will be included as an optional component of the College English Test (CET). We have all taken, and are thus familiar with, English tests of many kinds, but so far most of them are written ones. Have you any idea of what a spoken English test will be like, and is it necessary to go to all the trouble to hold or take such a test? People differ in their answers.
Many people will think it necessary. They know that although they have taken dozens, even hundreds, of English tests ever since they started learning it and many even have got surprisingly high marks, few of them can express themselves freely in spoken English, and if people can’t speak a word of it, what’s the sense of learning it and what do those high marks mean?—They’re none but deaf-and-mutes before the native speakers. Furthermore, with so many college graduates and undergraduates having mutes before the native speakers. Furthermore, with so many college graduates and undergraduates having passed CET4 and CET6, a test of spoken English is a further way to tell the excellent from the not so excellent. Finally, it is viewed as a new challenge to those who “live and learn”.
There are, however, also people who think differently. Besides the pains in preparation for such a new kind of test, there is also the uncertainty about the reliability and objectivity of the marking system, which may depend mainly on human (and thus subjective) scoring instead of on machine scoring, as in the case of a standardized objective test such as CET4 and CET6.
At the prospect of this optional test, I feel encouraged and regard it as a welcome challenge and another opportunity to improve my language ability and career potentials. I am determined to practice my oral English more often, and if I am qualified for such a test, I will not hesitate a moment to apply for it.

Part II Reading Comprehension
本文是一篇论述20世纪二、三十年代美国农业所面临的困境及美国政府采取的种种措施帮助农业摆脱困境的说明文，全文三段，第一段为背景辅垫: 美国农业面临的困境及其原因和对农民的灾难性后果；第二、三段为主体，美国政府振兴农业的措施，尤以第三段为重点，三十年代罗斯福总统执政后采取的通过立法手段恢复农业经济的两个阶段的措施，前一阶段通过AAA法案直接减少耕地面积，并给农民有偿补助；第二阶段在AAA被最高法院认定为违宪后通过一系列殊途同归的基于耕地保养原则的削减耕地、洪涝挽救措施。
21.	答案为B 本题属要点归纳题，问及引起美国农产品需求量走下坡路的原因，答案当在第一段第一句: 句中“as”即是这因果关系的关键词。A只是使这一现象加重的原因，C、D则明显与短文内容相悖。
22.	答案为C 要点定位理解题。根据题意，本题答案必须从第二段确定政府采取直接干预农业供求矛盾，原则以为农民提供更大的经济稳定性，也即预防农民破产。选项B属第三段内容，A和D明显有悖文章内容。
23.	答案为D 本题也属要点归纳题。答案在短文第三段第三、四句，选项B、C均属政府行为，而非鼓励农民自己运河做的事。D与短文要点相运河甚远，self-sufficient 只在第一段提到。
24.	答案为D 本题也属要点归纳题。根据题意，确定答案在第三段第五句(no the grounds that...)部分，再可结合该段倒数第二句，从另一角度论证答案D的合理性。A中scarcity of farm products 在上一句，不属本题要点范围，B、C明显不合理。
25.	答案为D 要点归纳定位题。根据new laws,可确定本题问题指向第三段第二个层次。归纳该层次要点再结合24题答案，即可明确答案为D.选项B虽也似乎正确，但与本文主题关系较疏远，故不选。
本文为一篇关于人工智能研究开发的说明文。第一段通过五十年代人工智能先驱们的预言与当今现实脱节这一事实提出人工智能研究开发所面临的问题，第二段前2句论及这一问题的症结: try to separate the most abstract levels of thought and duplicate them with logical programs.从第三句开始进入全文的核心: 崭新的人工智能研究设想: 把人工智能的研究与天然智能的进化、人脑生物细胞蛋白质、人脑的神经系统研究结合起来。第三段论述了电脑—生物物理学家Conrad对自己这方面研究的评论、发现、启示和设想。最后一段为对这一全新的人工智能研究开发方法的评论与总结，其中自然隐含着作者的观点与态度。
26.	答案为D 要点归纳题。根据题意确定答案在第一段第二、三句。注意选项A中“are capable of reliably recognizing...”与短文中“struggle to reliably recognize...”(努力、竭力、试图)是不一致的，故不能选；更多的考生可能会误选C, 但①在效能(performance)上，当天电脑与50年代的电脑相距是非常大的；②本文探讨的是人工智能，而非电脑的一般效能，故选题时要紧扣短文主题。
27.	答案为B 要点推论题。人工智能研究开发为什么会开辟一条全新的途径，一定是研究中碰到了难以逾越的障碍，这就是传统研究方法上的误区，也即第二段之第一、二句。
28.	答案为C 要点推论题。根据题意确定答案在第三段根据Conrad对自己研究的评述(says)，研究中的发现(examples)，假设(believe)与断言(claim)，可归纳推断他们是在天然智能如何发展这一方面的研究中做了巨大的努力。
29.	答案为B 作者观点态度推论题。如前所述，文章最后一段为作者对人工智能研究新方法的总结，其中隐含着作者的观点，另外短文第二段最后一句中“promising”、“surely”、第三段第一句中“a huge step in the right direction...”等都流露了作者的态度一作者对新的人工智能研究运动是非常肯定的。选项A中的“will soon die out”，C中的“like a game rather than”及D中“nobody is sure”等均含否定意念，不能作为答案。
30.	答案为D 词语理解题。阅读中词语的理解也不能脱离短文主题: game 一词有游戏、竞赛方法规则、策略、计谋、方针对行动步骤等多种释义，D是短语的简单改写，不可能作为答案，B重点在获奖也与短文内容相运河甚远，也应排除。容易混淆的是选项C, 只是C侧重研究领域，即范围，而本文主题讨论研究方法即途径。
本文为一篇论及(美国)私人轿车环境影响的说明文，第一段提出了问题的严惩性与迫切性—尤其对于美国；第二、三段论及决策者及汽车工业面临的四大选择及对它们可行性的评价，作者基本肯定了其中的第四个方案，即引入电气汽车(寻找污染较短的绿色驱动系统)。
31.	答案为B 要点归纳题—第一段落主题。选项A、C和D均仅涉及问题的某个方面，只有B代表了私人轿车继续增长的真正后果。
32.	答案为C 要点推论题。根据第一段最后一句“It is unlikely... that other nations will accept a large and growing U.S. contribution to global climatic change”，再结合上文论及轿车问题和“face... political cost”等细节，可推知答案。
33.	答案为C 要点定位题。根据题干中的“solution”可确定答案在第二段，又根据“best”可进一步确定答案在该段第二句“... is the only sustainable (可持续) option”。
34.	答案为B 要点正误判断题。要点判断各选项涉及内容可能在短文的任何地方，但正确答案通常仍应与主题一致。A之因果关系与短文内容(第二段倒数第二句)不一致；C与短文内容(第二段最后一句及第一、二句)相矛盾；D也非短文最后一句之本意。
本文是关于Reebok鞋业公司营销策略的一篇说明文。第一段概述(通过管理层之口)其公司产品的目标市场；第二段论及其对高档消费人群这一块零售市场的营销策略；第三段论及营销策略的另一方面—精选批发商；最后一段谈市场预测及营销决策。
36.	答案为A 要点推论题。题干中的“managerial personnel”即为第一段的executives, 因此可知本题答案在第一段且为该段之主题: 目标市为多大，高层领导们当然不希望自己的产品仅供应一些雅皮士，再由下文之“children’s shoes for the under-18 set and walking for older customers”更可知其目标消费是多高层次的。容易错选的选项B侧重公司的生产策略，故不妥。
37.	答案为D 句意理解及要点暗示题。题干引号中那部分在第二段，答案当然应在第二段，而该段主要论及高档消费群体的零售网—只在精品专卖屋、体育用品专卖店及大百货商场销售。
38.	答案为A 要点归纳题。根据题干中“limit the number of distributions”确定答案在第三段该段论及即使产品供不应求时，也要对批发商有所选择，而过运河一段时间对批发商数量的限制主要是“out of necessity”(迫不得已)，因为需求量出乎意料地超过了供应能力。
39.	答案为C 要点理解定位题。题干中的“although”与短文第三段倒数第二句之“but”相呼应，答案即为该句的复述。
40.	答案为D 要点推论题。Nike (耐克)一词确定答案位置在最后一段，市场预测与决策。Nike 公司正是由于当时错误地判断了健身鞋流行的强度而导致了老产品(running shoes)的积压而不得不打折销售一这是市场预测不准确所导致的。

71.	on → by本题考点: 介词搭配，根据人们如何占用周围空间的方式来判断。本题易错改well-mannered为good-mannered, 但well-mannered为正确的复合词，有礼貌的、行为端庄的。
72.	unaware → aware本题考点: 上下文理解 → 反义词。such a person指上文的well-mannered person, 当然在街上 走时不会“目中无人”。
73.	as → than本题考点: 比较连词的关键搭配。根据上一行中之more即可确定改as为than.
74.	it → which本题考点: 句子结构，代词及定语从句。逗号后，人称代词he前的代词it显然不可能出现在正常的英语语句中，根据本句主从句的结构分析，即可确定两逗号间为一非限制定语从句。
75.	at → in本题考点: 介词基本用法。country前一段用介词in.
76.	hasn’t → hadn’t本题考点: 时态。综观进过第二实例的二、三、四段，短文全部倩了过去时间的时态。
77.	American → Arab本题考点: 上下文理解 → 相关词(反义)。第二例讲述的是一位赴阿拉伯传统餐宴的美国人不了解阿拉伯食品，闹出笑话，而主人顺水推舟，以自己的行为挽回美国人面子这样的一个故事。77题所在句子为虚拟语气: 如果他了解阿拉伯食品，他也许不至于如此举止。
78.	as → like本题考点: 易淆介词as意为“作为”，like意为“象”，根据本行意思，这里当是: 摆在他(美国人)面前一大片很薄的面包，在他眼里看上去非常像一块餐巾。因此，他就把那块面包拿起，塞到衣领里，让它挂在衬衫前。
79.	falls → fell本题考点: 时态，阐述见76题。本句意思为: 因此，他就把那块面包拿起，塞到衣领里，让它挂在衬衫前。
80.	of → 删，本题考点: 动词句型。say后换something等复合代词时为及物动词，不用介词，本句中said nothing为与后面copied并列的两个主句谓语动词。

Passage One
The piano and violin are girls’ instruments. Drums and trumpets are for boys. According to psychologists Susan Onco and Michael Balton, children have very clear ideas about which musical instruments they should play. They find that despite the best efforts of teachers these ideas have changed very little over the past decade. They interviewed 153 children aged between 9 and 11 from schools in northwest England. They asked them to identify 4 musical instruments and then to say which they would like to play most and which they would least lie to play. They also asked the children for their views on whether boys or girls should not play any of the 4 instruments. The piano and the violin were both ranked more favorably by girls than by boys, while boys prefer the drums and trumpets. There was broad agreement between boys and girls on which instruments each sex should play and the reasons vary. And while almost half of all boys said they avoid certain instruments because they were too difficult to play, only 15% of girls gave that as a reason. Earlier studies indicated that very young school children aged between 5 and 7 showed no bias in choosing musical instruments, but their tastes become more clear between the ages of 8 and 10. One survey of 78 teachers suggested that after that age both boys and girls.
11.	Why did Susan and Michael interview children aged between 9 and 11?
12.	Why do many of the boys avoid certain instruments?
13.	Which group of children have a bias when choosing musical instruments?
Passage Two
In the 1970s, the famous Brazilian football player Pele retired from the national team of Brazil and became a professional player for a team in New York. Football, or soccer, wasn’t very popular in the United States at that time. Few North Americans knew anything about this fast-moving sport. There was no money to pay professional players and there was little interest in football in high schools and colleges. When Pele and other international stars began playing in various US cities, people saw how interesting the game was and began to go to the matches. It is now common for important games to have fifty to sixty thousand fans. Support from the fans is important to the football. The fans cheer enthusiastically for their favorite players and teams, who respond by playing better than before. In most World Cups, the home team, or the team from the host country usually plays better than most people expect. In 1966, 1974 and 1978, the home teams of England, West Germany and Argentina all won the World Cup. The World Cup is called that because teams from every continent have played in it. However, since the Cup began, all of the winning teams have been from Europe or South America. Teams from Asia or Africa always do well but they haven’t yet won. Mexico played surprisingly well in the 1970 Cup, which it hosted, but it wasn’t among the 4 final teams.
14.	Why wasn’t football a popular sport in the U.S. in the 1970s?
15.	When does a football team have the best chance to win the World Cup?
16.	How did Mexico do in the 1970 World Cup?
Passage Three
The world’s smartest adolescence in mathematics and science are in Singapore, according to a global survey of educational achievement. In the 3rd International Mathematics and Science Study, 13-year-olds from Singapore achieved the best scores in standardized tests of maths and science that were administered to 287,896 students in 41 countries in 1994 and 1995. The survey suggests that science and maths education is especially strong in the Far East. While well behind those top scores, students from Australia earned higher marks in maths than their counterparts in England, who in turn did better than American students. The study collected information on the students’ teachers and homes. Not surprisingly, the highest-scoring students had well-educated parents or came from homes containing study-aids such as computers, dictionaries or even such elemental facilities as desks. The study shows that boys generally did better than girls in science, but there was little difference between them in maths. Boys scored better than girls in physics and chemistry. There were no sex differences in the life and environmental sciences. In addition to being tested, students in the project were asked how proficient they thought they were in maths and science. Students in some countries, such as Columbia and Kuwait, had an overly optimistic view of their skills. Meanwhile, some of the best students from Japan and Korea for example were needlessly pessimistic even though they did far better in maths than almost all of other students.
17.	Of the 4 groups of students, who scored the lowest in maths according to the survey?
18.	What kind of students are most likely to become top scorers?
19.	In what way do Columbian students differ from Japanese students?
20.	In which subjects did boys score higher than girls?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 reading passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
Birds that are literally half asleep—with one brain hemisphere alert and the other sleeping—control which side of the brain remains awake, according to a new study of sleeping ducks.
Earlier studies have documented half brain sleep in a wide range of birds. The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere’s eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once.
Decades of studies of bird flocks led researchers to predict extra alertness in the more vulnerable, end of the row sleepers. Sure enough, the end birds tended to watch carefully on the side away from their companions. Ducks in the inner spots showed no preference for gaze direction.
Also, birds dozing (打盹) at the end of the line resorted to single hemisphere sleep, rather than total relaxation, more often than inner ducks did. Rotating 16 birds through the positions in a four duck row, the researchers found outer birds half asleep during some 32 percent of dozing time versus about 12 percent for birds in internal spots.
“We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain,” the researchers say.
The results provide the best evidence for a long standing supposition that single hemisphere sleep evolved as creatures scanned for enemies. The preference for opening an eye on the lookout side could be widespread, he predicts. He’s seen it in a pair of birds dozing side by side in the zoo and in a single pet bird sleeping by a mirror. The mirror side eye closed as if the reflection were a companion and the other eye stayed open.
Useful as half sleeping might be, it’s only been found in birds and such water mammals (哺乳动物) as dolphins, whales, and seals. Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning.
Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep. Jerome M. Siegel of the UCLA says he wonders if birds’ half brain sleep “is just the tip of the iceberg (冰山)” He speculates that more examples may turn up when we take a closer look at other species.
11.	A new study on birds’ sleep has revealed that ________.
A) half brain sleep is found in a wide variety of birds

A) the phenomenon of birds dozing in pairs is widespread
B) birds prefer to sleep in pairs for the sake of security

Passage Two
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
A nine year old schoolgirl single handedly cooks up a science fair experiment that ends up debunking (揭穿…的真相) a widely practiced medical treatment. Emily Rosa’s target was a practice known as therapeutic (治疗的) touch (TT for short), whose advocates manipulate patients’ “energy fieldto make them feel better and even, say some, to cure them of various ills. Yet Emily’s test shows that these energy fields can’t be detected, even by trained TT practitioners (行医者). Obviously mindful of the publicity value of the situation, Journal editor George Lundberg appeared on TV to declare, “Age doesn’t matter. It’s good science that matters, and this is good science.”
Emily’s mother Linda Rosa, a registered nurse, has been campaigning against TT for nearly a decade. Linda first thought about TT in the late ‘80s, when she learned it was on the approved list for continuing nursing education in Colorado. Its 100,000 trained practitioners (48,000 in the U.S.) don’t even touch their patients. Instead, they waved their hands a few inches from the patient’s body, pushing energy fields around until they’re in “balance.” TT advocates say these manipulations can help heal wounds, relieve Pain and reduce fever. The claims are taken seriously enough that TT therapists are frequently hired by leading hospitals, at up to $70 an hour, to smooth patients’ energy, sometimes during surgery.
Yet Rosa could not find any evidence that it works. To provide such proof, TT therapists would have to sit down for independent testing—something they haven’t been eager to do, even though James Randi has offered more than $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate the existence of a human energy field. (He’s had one taker so far. She failed.) A skeptic might conclude that TT practitioners are afraid to lay their beliefs on the line. But who could turn down an innocent fourth grader? Says Emily: “I think they didn’t take me very seriously because I’m a kid.”
The experiment was straight forward: 21 TT therapists stuck their hands, palms up, through a screen. Emily held her own hand over one of theirs left or right and the practitioners had to say which hand it was. When the results were recorded, they’d done no better than they would have by simply guessing. If there was an energy field, they couldn’t feel it.
16.	Which of the following is evidence that TT is widely practiced?
A) TT has been in existence for decades.
B) Many patients were cured by therapeutic touch.
C) TT therapists are often employed by leading hospitals.
D) More than 100,000 people are undergoing TT treatment.
17.	Very few TT practitioners responded to the $1 million offer because ________.
A) they didn’t take the offer seriously
B) they didn’t want to risk their career
C) they were unwilling to reveal their secret
D) they thought it was not in line with their practice
18.	The purpose of Emily Rosa’s experiment was ________.
A) to see why TT could work the way it did
B) to find out how TT cured patients’ illnesses
C) to test whether she could sense the human energy field
D) to test whether a human energy field really existed
19.	Why did some TT practitioners agree to be the subjects of Emil’s experiment?
A) It involved nothing more than mere guessing.
B) They thought it was going to be a lot of fun.
C) It was more straightforward than other experiments.
D) They sensed no harm in a little girl’s experiment.
20.	What can we learn from the passage?
A) Some widely accepted beliefs can be deceiving.
B) Solid evidence weighs more than pure theories.
C) Little children can be as clever as trained TT practitioners.
D) The principle of TT is too profound to understand.
Passage Three
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
What might driving on an automated highway be like? The answer depends on what kind of sys tem is ultimately adopted. Two distinct types are on the drawing board. The first is a special purpose lane system, in which certain lanes are reserved for automated vehicles. The second is a mixed traffic system: fully automated vehicles would share the road with partially automated or manual driven cars. A special purpose lane system would require more extensive physical modifications to existing highways, but it promises the greatest gains in freeway (高速公路) capacity.
Under either scheme, the driver would specify the desired destination, furnishing this information to a computer in the car at the beginning of the trip or perhaps just before reaching the automated highway. If a mixed traffic system way was in place, automated driving could begin whenever the driver was on suitably equipped roads. If special purpose lanes were available, the car could enter them and join existing traffic in two different ways. One method would use a special onramp (入口引道). As the driver approached the point of entry for the highway, devices installed on the roadside would electronically check the vehicle to determine its destination and to ascertain that it had the proper automation equipment in good working order. Assuming it passed such tests, the driver would then be guided through a gate and toward an automated lane. In this case, the transition from manual to auto mated control would take place on the entrance ramp. An alternative technique could employ conventional lanes, which would be shared by automated and regular vehicles. The driver would steer onto the highway and move in normal fashion to a “transition” lane. The vehicle would then shift under computer control onto a lane reserved for automated traffic. (The limitation of these lanes to automated traffic would, presumably, be well respected, because all trespassers (非法进入者) could be swiftly identified by authorities.)
Either approach to joining a lane of automated traffic would harmonize the movement of newly entering vehicles with those already traveling. Automatic control here should allow for smooth merging without the usual uncertainties and potential for accidents. And once a vehicle had settled into automated travel, the driver would be free to release the wheel, open the morning paper or just relax.
21.	We learn from the first paragraph that two systems of automated highways ________.
A) are being planned
B) are being modified
C) are now in wide use
D) are under construction
22.	A special purpose lane system is probably advantageous in that ________.
A) it would require only minor changes to existing highways
B) it would achieve the greatest highway traffic efficiency
C) it has a lane for both automated and partially automated vehicles
D) it offers more lanes for automated vehicles
23.	Which of the following is true about driving on an automated highway?
A) Vehicles traveling on it are assigned different lanes according to their destinations.
B) A car can join existing traffic any time in a mixed lane system.
C) The driver should inform his car computer of his destination before driving onto it.
D) The driver should share the automated lane with those of regular vehicles.
24.	We know from the passage that a car can enter a special purpose lane ________.
A) by smoothly merging with cars on the conventional lane
B) by way of a ramp with electronic control devices
C) through a specially guarded gate
D) after all trespassers are identified and removed
25.	When driving in an automated lane, the driver ________.
A) should harmonize with newly entering cars
B) doesn’t have to rely on his computer system
C) should watch out for potential accidents
D) doesn’t have to hold on to the steering wheel
Passage Four
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths. At the top of the list is the notion that intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems; to read, write and compute at certain levels; and to resolve abstract equations quickly. This vision of intelligence asserts formal education and bookish excellence as the true measures of self fulfillment. It encourages a kind of intellectual prejudice that has brought with it some discouraging results. We have come to believe that someone who has more educational merit badges, who is very good at some form of school discipline is “intelligent.” Yet mental hospitals are filled with patients who have all of the properly lettered certificates. A truer indicator of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.
If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person. Problem solving is a useful help to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent. You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N.B.D.—Nervous Break Down.
“Intelligent people do not have N.B.D.’s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the problems of their lives.
You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances. The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us. Every one who is involved with other human beings in any social context has similar difficulties. Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human. Similarly, money, growing old, sickness, deaths, natural disasters and accidents are all events which present problems to virtually all human beings. But some people are able to make it, to avoid immobilizing depression and unhappiness despite such occurrences, while others collapse or have an N.B.D. Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.
26.	According to the author, the conventional notion of intelligence measured in terms of one’s ability to read, write and compute ________.
A) is a widely held but wrong concept
B) will help eliminate intellectual prejudice
C) is the root of all mental distress
D) will contribute to one’s self fulfillment
27.	It is implied in the passage that holding a university degree ________.
A) may result in one’s inability to solve complex real life problems
B) does not indicate one’s ability to write properly worded documents
C) may make one mentally sick and physically weak
D) does not mean that one is highly intelligent
28.	The author thinks that an intelligent person knows ________.
A) how to put up with some very prevalent myths
B) how to find the best way to achieve success in tire
C) how to avoid depression and make his life worthwhile
D) how to persuade others to compromise
29.	In the last paragraph, the author tells us that ________.
A) difficulties are but part of everyone’s life
B) depression and unhappiness are unavoidable in life
C) everybody should learn to avoid trying circumstances
D) good feelings can contribute to eventual academic excellence
30.	According to the passage, what kind of people are rare?
A) Those who don’t emphasize bookish excellence in their pursuit of happiness.
B) Those who are aware of difficulties in life but know how to avoid unhappiness.
C) Those who measure happiness by an absence of problems but seldom suffer from N.B.D’s.
D) Those who are able to secure happiness though having to struggle against trying circumstances.

2001年1月六级答案详解
Part I Listening Comprehension
Part II Reading Comprehension
11.	正确答案为C)。根据文章第1、3-6段可知，对鸟类睡眠的最新研究表明，它们能够有意识地控制自己的半脑睡眠。这几段举例说明了对这个问题实验的情况。选项A)、B)、D)虽在文章第2 段中也提到了，但那是文献记载的以前研究的情况(Earlier studies have documented...)故均不是正确答案。
12.	正确答案为A)。根据文章第6段The results provide the best evidence for along standing supposition that single hemisphere sleep evolved as creatures scanned for enemies.(这些研究结果为一个长久以来的假设提供了最好的证据，即单侧脑睡眠是在生物警惕敌人过程中进化形成的。)
13.	正确答案为C)。根据文章第6段内容：鸟类单侧脑睡眠是在警惕敌人过程中进化而来，此结论还可推而广之。在需要警惕的一侧，鸟儿喜欢睁着一只眼睛…，一对动物园里的鸟儿挨着打瞌睡时 是如此，宠物鸟靠镜子一侧的眼睛闭着，好象镜子中的影子是一个伙伴，而另一只眼睛却睁着， 也说明这种情况。所以选项C)是答案。
14.	正确答案为B)。根据文章第7段第2句Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning.(也许，保持一侧脑醒着可以使睡眠中的动物不时浮出水面而刁；淹死。)所以B) emerge from water now and then to breathe (不时浮出水面来呼吸)是正确答案。
15.	正确答案为D)。根据文章最后的一段，也就是含有这个短语的上下文。Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep... He (Siegel) speculates that more examples may turn up when we take closer look at other species.(对鸟类的研究可能提供对睡眠的独特认识。...他推测当我们对其他物种仔细观察时，就会发现更多的例证。)因此选项D)所说“半侧脑睡眠这种现象可能存在于其他物种”正是“just the tip of iceberg”所表达的意思。
16.	正确答案为C)。根据第2段The claims are taken seriously enough that TT therapists are frequently hired by leading hospitals.(这种宣扬很受重视，以致TT行医者经常受雇于大的医院…)选项A)文章中没有提及，选项B)叙述不准确，文中只是说，据称这种方法能使人病情好转，甚至说有的能治疗各种疾病”。选项D)与文章内容不符，文章说，川万受过培训的TT行医者甚至不接触病人身体…。故A)，B)，D)均不是答案。
17.	正确答案为C)。根据文章第3段第2句：为了提供这样一个证明(证明人有“能场”)，TT行医者不得不坐下接受独立的测试—这是他们一直都不愿意做的事情，即使詹姆斯·兰迪为能演示人存在“能场”的人提供一百多万美元的奖金。 (To provide such proof, TT therapists would have to sit down for independent testing something they haven’t been eager to do, even though James Landi has offered more than $ 1 million to anyone who can demonstrate the existence of a human energy field.)
18.	正确答案为D)。根据文章第1段我们知道，TT行医者所宣扬的就是通过调节病人的“能场”来治病(whose advocates manipulate patient’s “energy field” to make them feel better and even, say some, to cure them of various ills)。在第2段中，又提到“运用这种手法可以推动能场转动直到平衡(... pushing energy fields around until they’re in “balance”)”而爱米丽·瑞莎的实验就是证明是否能场真的存在。特别文章最后一句If there was an energy field, they couldn’t feel it.(如果有一个能场的话，他们也感觉不到。)选项C)说是测试她能否感觉到能场，如果是这样的话，前提是存在一个能场，这当然是错误的。A)，B)两个选项也是错误的。
19.	正确答案为D)。根据文章第3段从第2句到段末这部分：A skeptic might conclude that TT practitioners are afraid to lay their beliefs on the line. But who would turn down an innocent, fourth grader? Says Emily: “I think they didn’t take me very seriously because I’m a kid”.(怀疑的人或许会因为TT行医者害怕使他们自己处于被揭露的危险中，但谁能拒绝一个天真的四年级的小学生呢?爱米丽说，“我想他们不会太把我当回事，因为我是个小孩子。”)
20.	正确答案为A)。此题要求概括主题。文章第1句就是主题句：A nine year old schoolgirl single-handly cooks up a science fair experiment the ends up debunking a widely practiced medical treatment. (一个9岁的小女孩独自设计了一个公开的科学实验，结果揭穿了一种广为流行的医疗方法的真相。)
21.	正确答案为A)。根据第1段第2，3句：The answer depends on what kind of system is ultimately adopted. Two distinct types are on the drawing board. (答案取决于最后采用哪一种系统，两种不同的类型都在绘图板上。)回答此问题的关键是要知道drawing board的意思。所以选项A) are being planned是正确答案。
22.	正确答案为B)。根据第1段最后一句：A special purpose lane system would require more extensive physical modifications to existing highways, but it promises the greatest gains in freeway capacity (特别目的车道系统要求对现有的高速公路进行更广泛的改造，但它会使高速公路获得最大的能力。)
23.	正确答案为C)。根据第2段第1句：Under either scheme, the driver would specify the desired destination, furnishing this information to a computer in the car at the beginning of the trip or perhaps just before reaching the automated highway.(不论采用那种设计，司机都需要在其开始行驶时或在到达自动化高速公路前确定要去的目的地，把这个信息输入车上的计算机。)故C)是正确答案。选项B)与文章内容相悖，因为原文第2段第2句是on suitably equipped roads而不是existing traffic.选项D)提到的情况只适用于第2种设计方案，即混合式交通系统。故A)，B)，D)均不是答案。
24.	正确答案为B)。根据文章第2段第3，4，5句：如果使用特殊目的的车道…一种方法是使用特殊的人口引道。当司机接近高速公路人口处时，安装在道边的电子装置会检测车辆的目的地并搞清是否有能工作的自动化装置。 (If special purpose lanes were available,... One method would use a special onramp. As drivers approached the point of entry for the highway, devices installed on the roadside would electronically check the vehicle to determine its destination and to ascertain that it had the proper automation equipment in good working order.)
25.	正确答案为D)。根据第3段的最后一句：And once a vehicle had settled into automated travel, the driver would be free to release the wheel, open the morning paper or just relax. (一旦车辆进入自动行驶状态，司机就可以放开方向盘，打开晨报或者只是休息。)
26.	正确答案为A)。这是一篇新老观点对应性文章。老观点也就是平常的大家普遍接受的观点：聪明指的是受到正规教育，成绩优秀，并以此作为自我完善的手段。新观点强调心理健康，否定老观点，所以A)是答案。
27.	正确答案为D)。通读全文我们知道，作者认为真正能体现聪明的是能否过一种有意义；愉快的生活，每天，每时都是这样。而获得大学学位的人未必能做到。所以选项D)与作者的这种观点相符，是正确答案。选项C)有一定的干扰性，虽然作者说神经病医院里满是持有各种证书的病人。但这并不是说持有大学学位可能使一个人神经得病或身体虚弱。
28.	正确答案为C)。选项A)与文章内容相悖，文章说要摒弃某些很流行的说法(putting rest some very prevalent myths)，而不是要忍耐这些说法。选项B)和选项D)的内容在文章中均未提到， 故只有选项C)是正确答案。另外，也可以根据第2段第1句来推断：If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person. (如果你感到愉快，如果你为所有值得的事物活每一时刻，你就是一个聪明的人。)
29.	正确答案为A)。根据第4段第2，3，4句的内容：在任何社会环境中与别人交往，每个人都有相的困难。意见不合，冲突和妥协是作为人的一部分存在的。 (Everyone who is involved with other human in any social context has similar difficulties. Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human.)选项A)与之相符，是正确答案。选项B)干扰性较大，这与原文不符。原文说But some people are able to make it, to avoid immobilizing depression and unhappiness despite such occurrences.(但有些人能克服，尽管有这些事情发生，他们能避免陷入沮丧和不愉快中不能自拔。)这意味着生活中的沮丧和不愉快是可以避免的。
30.	正确答案为B)。根据第4段最后一句：Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of human we know, also the most rare. (那些认识到困难是人生必然存在的事物，不以有没有困难来衡量愉快，是我们所知最聪明的一类人，也是很罕见的人。)

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or finished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Our culture has caused most Americans to assume not only that our language is universal but that the gestures we use are understood by everyone. We do not realize that waving good-bye is the way to summon a person from the Philippines to one’s side, or that in Italy and some Latin-American countries, curling the finger to oneself is a sign of farewell.
Those private citizens who sent packages to our troops occupying Germany after World War II and marked them GIFT to escape duty payments did not bother to find out that “Gift” means poison in German. Moreover, we like to think of ourselves as friendly, yet we prefer to be at least 3 feet or an arm’s length away from others. Latins and Middle Easterners like to come closer and touch, which makes Americans uncomfortable.
Our linguistic (语言上的) and cultural blindness and the casualness with which we take notice of the developed tastes, gestures, customs and languages of other countries, are losing us friends, business and respect in the world.
Even here in the United States, we make few concessions to the needs of foreign visitors. There are no information signs in four languages on our public buildings or monuments; we do not have multilingual (多语言的) guided tours. Very few restaurant menus have translations, and multilingual waiters, bank clerks and policemen are rare. Our transportation systems have maps in English only and often we ourselves have difficulty understanding them.
When we go abroad, we tend to cluster in hotels and restaurants where English is spoken. Then attitudes and information we pick up are conditioned by those natives—usually the richer—who speak English. Our business dealings, as well as the nation’s diplomacy, are conducted through interpreters.
For many years, American dollars no longer buy all good things, and we are slowly beginning to realize that our proper role in the world is changing. A 1979 Harris poll reported that 55 percent of Americans want this country to play a more significant role in world affairs; we want to have a hand in the important decisions of the next century, even though it may not always he the upper hand.

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
In department stores and closets all over the world, they are waiting. Their outward appearance seems rather appealing because they come in a variety of styles, textures, and colors. But they are ultimately the biggest deception that exists in the fashion industry today. What are they? They are high heels—a woman’s worst enemy (whether she knows it or not). High heel shoes are the downfall of modern society. Fashion myths have led women to believe that they are more beautiful or sophisticated for wearing heels, but in reality, heels succeed in posing short as well as long term hardships. Women should fight the high heel industry by refusing to use or purchase them in order to save the world from unnecessary physical and psychological suffering.
For the sake of fairness, it must be noted that there is a positive side to high heels. First, heels are excellent for aerating (使通气) lawns. Anyone who has ever worn heels on grass knows what I am talking about. A simple trip around the yard in a pair of those babies eliminates all need to call for a lawn care specialist, and provides the perfect-sized holes to give any lawn oxygen without all those messy chunks of dirt lying around. Second, heels are quite functional for defense against oncoming enemies, who can easily be scared away by threatening them with a pair of these sharp, deadly fashion accessories.
Regardless of such practical uses for heels, the fact remains that wearing high heels is harmful to one’s physical health. Talk to any podiatrist (足病医生)， and you will hear that the majority of their business comes from high-heel-wearing women. High heels are known to cause problems such as deformed feet and torn toenails. The risk of severe back problems and twisted or broken ankles is three times higher for a flat shoe wearer. Wearing heels also creates the threat of getting a heel caught in a sidewalk crack or a sewer-grate (阴沟栅) and being thrown to the ground—possibly breaking a nose, back, or neck. And of course, after wearing heels for a day, any woman knows she can look forward to a night of pain as she tries to comfort her swollen, aching feet.
26.	What makes women blind to the deceptive nature of high heels?
A) The multi-functional use of high heels.
B) Their attempt to show off their status.
C) The rich variety of high heel styles.
D) Their wish to improve their appearance.
27.	The author’s presentation of the positive side of high heels is meant ________.
A) to be ironic
B) to poke fun at women
C) to be fair to the fashion industry
D) to make his point convincing
28.	The author uses the expression “those babies” (Line 3, Para. 2) to refer to high heels ________.
A) to show their fragile characteristics
B) to indicate their feminine features
C) to show women’s affection for them
D) to emphasize their small size
29.	The author’s chief argument against high heels is that ________.
A) they pose a threat to lawns
B) they are injurious to women’s health
C) they don’t necessarily make women beautiful
D) they are ineffective as a weapon of defense
30.	It can be inferred from the passage that women should ________.
A) see through the very nature of fashion myths
B) boycott the products of the fashion industry
C) go to a podiatrist regularly for advice
D) avoid following fashion too closely
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
It is hardly necessary for me to cite all the evidence of the depressing state of literacy. These figures from the Department of Education are sufficient: 27 million Americans cannot read at all, and a further 35 million read at a level that is less than sufficient to survive in our society.
but my own worry today is less that of the overwhelming problem of elemental literacy than it is of the slightly more luxurious problem of the decline in the skill even of the middle-class reader, of his unwillingness to afford those spaces of silence, those luxuries of domesticity and time and concentration, that surround the image of the classic act of reading. It has been suggested that almost 80 percent of America’s literate, educated teenagers can no longer read without an accompanying noise (music) in the background or a television screen flickering (闪烁) at the corner of their field of perception. We know very little about the brain and how it deals with simultaneous conflicting input, but every common-sense intuition suggests we should be profoundly alarmed. This violation of concentration, silence, solitude (独处的状态) goes to the very heart of our notion of literacy; this new form of part-reading, of part-perception against background distraction, renders impossible certain essential acts of apprehension and concentration, let alone that most important tribute any human being can pay to a poem or a piece of prose he or she really loves, which is to learn it by heart. Not by brain, by heart; the expression is vital.
Under these circumstances, the question of what future there is for the arts of reading is a real one. Ahead of us lie technical, psychic (心理的), and social transformations probably much more dramatic than those brought about by Gutenberg, the German inventor in printing. The Gutenberg revolution, as we now know it, took a long time; its effects are still being debated. The information revolution will touch every fact of composition, publication, distribution, and reading. No one in the book industry can say with any confidence what will happen to the book as we’ve known it.
31.	The picture of the reading ability of the American people, drawn by the author, is ________.
A) rather bleak
B) fairly bright
C) very impressive
D) quite encouraging
32.	The author’s biggest concern is ________.
A) elementary school children’s disinterest in reading classics
B) the surprisingly low rate of literacy in the U.S.
C) the musical setting American readers require for reading
D) the reading ability and reading behavior of the middle class
33.	A major problem with most adolescents who can read is ________.
A) their fondness of music and TV programs
B) their ignorance of various forms of art and literature
C) their lack of attentiveness and basic understanding
D) their inability to focus on conflicting input
34.	The author claims that the best way a reader can show admiration for a piece of poetry or prose is ________.
A) to be able to appreciate it and memorize it
B) to analyze its essential features
C) to think it over conscientiously
D) to make a fair appraisal of its artistic value
35.	About the future of the arts of reading the author feels ________.
A) upset
B) uncertain
C) alarmed
D) pessimistic
Passage Four
Questions 35 to 40 are based on the following passage.
For centuries, explorers have risked their lives venturing into the unknown for reasons that were to varying degrees economic and nationalistic. Columbus went west to look for better trade routes to the Orient and to promote the greater glory of Spain. Lewis and Clark journeyed into the American wilderness to find out what the U.S. had acquired when it purchased Louisiana, and the Apollo astronauts rocketed to the moon in a dramatic show of technological muscle during the cold war.
Although their missions blended commercial and political-military imperatives, the explorers involved all accomplished some significant science simply by going where no scientists had gone before.
Today Mars looms（隐约出现）as humanity’s next great terra incognita（未探明之地）. And with doubtful prospects for a short-term financial return, with the cold war a rapidly fading memory and amid a growing emphasis on international cooperation in large space ventures, it is clear that imperatives other than profits or nationalism will have to compel human beings to leave their tracks on the planet’s reddish surface. Could it be that science, which has long played a minor role in exploration, is at last destined to take a leading role? The question naturally invites a couple of others: Are there experiments that only humans could do on Mars? Could those experiments provide insights profound enough to justify the expense of sending people across interplanetary space?
With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been. The issue of whether life ever existed on the planet, and whether it persists to this day, has been highlighted by mounting evidence that the Red Planet once had abundant stable, liquid water and by the continuing controversy over suggestions that bacterial fossils rode to Earth on a meteorite（陨石）from valuable data about the range of conditions under which a planet can generate the complex chemistry that leads to life. If it could be established that life arose independently on Mars and Earth, the finding would provide the first concrete clues in one of the deepest mysteries in all of science: the prevalence of life in the universe.
36.	According to the passage, the chief purpose of explorers in going to unknown places in the past was ________.
A) to display their country’s military might
B) to accomplish some significant science
C) to find new areas for colonization
D) to pursue commercial and state interests
37.	At present, a probable inducement for countries to initiate large-scale space ventures is ________.
A) international cooperation
B) scientific research
C) nationalistic reasons
D) long-term pro fits
38.	What is the main goal of sending human missions to Mars?
A) To find out if life ever existed there.
B) To see if humans could survive there.
C) To prove the feasibility of large-scale space ventures.
D) To show the leading role of science in space exploration.
39.	By saying “With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been” (Line 1, Para. 4), the author means that ________.
A) with Mars the risks involved are much greater than any previous space ventures
B) in the case of Mars, the rewards of scientific exploration can be very high
C) in the case of Mars, much more research funds are needed than ever before
D) with Mars, scientists argue, the fundamental interests of science are at issue
40.	The passage tells us that proof of life on Mars would ________.
A) make clear the complex chemistry in the development of life
B) confirm the suggestion that bacterial fossils traveled to Earth on a meteorite
C) reveal the kind of conditions under which life originates
D) provide an explanation why life is common in the universe

More people of tuberculosis (结核病)than of any other disease caused by a single agent. This has probably been the case in quite a white. During the early stages of the industrial revolution, perhaps one in every seventh deaths is Europe’s crowded cities were caused by the disease. From now on, though, western eyes, missing the global picture, saw the trouble going into decline. With occasional breaks for war, the rates of death and infection in the Europe and America dropped steadily through the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1950s, the introduction of antibiotics(抗菌素)strengthened the trend in rich countries, and the antibiotics were allowed to be imported to poor countries. Medical researchers declared victory and withdrew.
They are wrong. In the mid-1980s the frequency of infections and deaths started to pick up again around the world. Where tuberculosis vanished, it came back; in many places where it had never been away, it grew better. The World Heath Organization estimates that 1. 7 billion people (a third of the earth’s population) suffer from tuberculosis. Even the infection rate was falling, population growth kept the number of clinical cases more or less constantly at 8 million a year. Around 3 million of those people died, nearly all of them in poor countries.

Passage one
Last August, Susan and 42 other students got wet and dirty while removing six tons of garbage from the river running across their city. They cleaned up the river as part of a week-long environmental camp. Like one in three American rivers, this river is so polluted that it’s unsafe for swimming and fishing, still, Susan, who has just completed her third summer on the river clean-up, scene has changed in this river. “Since we started three years ago, the river is getting a lot cleaner”, she says. Environmental scientists praised the teenagers for removing garbage that can harm wild life. Waterbirds, for example, can choke on plastic bottle rings and get cut by scrap metal. Three years ago, when the clean-up started, garbage was everywhere, but this year, the teenagers had to hunt for garbage. They turn the clean-up into a competition to see who could find the most garbage and unload their boats fastest. By the end of the six hour shift, they have removed enough garbage to fill more than two large trucks. “Seeing all their garbage in the river makes people begin to care about environmental issues,” Susan says. She hopes that when others read that she and her peers care enough to clean it up, maybe they will think twice before they throw garbage in the river.
Questions 11-13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	What does the passage tell us about American rivers?
12.	What did the students find when they came to the river this year?
13.	What is the expected reaction of the local people to the students’ efforts?
Passage Two
Why do we cry? Can you imagine life without tears? Not only do tears keep your eyes lubricated, they also contain a substance that kills certain bacteria so they can’t infect your eyes. Give up your tears, and you’ll lose this on-the-spot defense. Nobody wants to give up the flood of extra tears you produce when you get something physical or chemical in your eyes. Tears are very good at washing this irritating stuff out. Another thing you couldn’t do without your tears is cry from joy, anger or sadness. Humans are the only animals that produce tears in response to emotions, and most people say a good cry makes them feel better. Many scientists, therefore, believe that crying somehow helps us cope with emotional situations. Tear researcher, Winifred, is trying to figure out how it happens. One possibility he says is that tears discharge certain chemicals from your body, chemicals that build up during stress. When people talk about crying it out, “I think that might actually be what they are doing”, he says. If Fred is right, what do you think will happen to people who restrain their tears? Boys, for example, cry only about a quarter as often as girls once they reach teenage years, and we all cry a lot less now than we did as babies. Could it possibly be that we face less stress? Maybe we found another ways to deal with it, or maybe we just feel embarrassed.
Questions 14-17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What’s the topic discussed in this passage?
15.	What is Winifred trying to find out?
16.	What does the passage say about teenage boys and girls?
17.	What’s the difference between human beings and other animals when shedding tears?
Passage three
Imaging this: you wake up each morning to find your sister lying beside you, to get dressed and tie your shoes, you use one hand and she uses another. You do everything out together, too, even sitting on the same chair at lunch and riding on the same bicycle. That’s what life is like for six-year-old Betty and Abby. Like most twins, the two girls look very much alike, but unlike most twins, Betty and Abby share parts of the same body. Twins like Betty and Abby are rare. Only about 40 sets are born in the United States each year. Few survive as long as Betty and Abby. That’s because twins often share vital organs, like a heart or brain. The shared organs are often badly shaped and may not be strong enough to support both twins. But Betty and Abby each has her own head, heart and stomach which function normally. Because she has three or four lungs which provide plenty of oxygen for both twins. Most of their completely shared organs lie below the waist. Betty And Abby live relatively normal lives. They attend a regular school, and each does her own school work. They prefer to do some projects together, though, for example, to cut out paper dolls, one twin holds the paper, while the other uses the scissors. But sometimes, the girls don’t want to do the same thing, for example, sometimes they want to play with different toys. What do they do then? “We toss a coin”, says Abby.
Questions 18-20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	In what aspect, do Betty and Abby differ from most twins?
19.	What does the passage tell us about twins who share parts of the same body?
20.	What does the passage say about the education of the twin girls?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Navigation computers, now sold by most car-makers, cost $2,000 and up. No surprise, then, that they are most often found in luxury cars, like Lexus, BMW and Audi. But it is a developing technology—meaning prices should eventually drop—and the market does seem to be growing.
Even at current prices, a navigation computer is impressive. It can guide you from point to point in most major cities with precise turn-by-turn directions—spoken by a clear human-sounding voice, and written on a screen in front of the driver.
The computer works with an antenna (天线) that takes signals from no fewer than three of the 24 global positioning system (GPS) satellites. By measuring the time required for a signal to travel between the satellites and the antenna, the car’s location can be pinned down within 100 meters.
The satellite signals, along with inputs on speed from a wheel-speed sensor and direction from a meter, determine the car’s position even as it moves. This information is combined with a map database. Streets, landmarks and points of interest are included.
Most systems are basically identical. The differences come in hardware—the way the computer accepts the driver’s request for directions and the way it presents the driving instructions. On most systems, a driver enters a desired address, motorway junction or point of interest via a touch screen or disc. But the Lexus screen goes a step further: you can point to any spot on the map screen and get directions to it.
BMW’s system offers a set of cross hairs (瞄准器上的十字纹) that can be moved across the map (you have several choices of map scale) to pick a point you’d like to get to. Audi’s screen can be switched to TV reception.
Even the voices that recite the directions can differ, with better systems like BMW’s and Lexus’s having a wider vocabulary. The instructions are available in French, German, Spanish, Dutch and Italian, as well as English. The driver can also choose parameters for determining the route: fastest, shortest or no freeways (高速公路), for example.
21.	We learn from the passage that navigation computers ________.
A) will greatly promote sales of automobiles
B) may help solve potential traffic problems
C) are likely to be accepted by more drivers

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
“The world’s environment is surprisingly healthy. Discuss.” If that were an examination topic, most students would tear it apart, offering a long list of complaints: from local smog (烟雾) to global climate change, from the felling (砍伐) of forests to the extinction of species. The list would largely be accurate, the concern legitimate. Yet the students who should be given the highest marks would actually be those who agreed with the statement. The surprise is how good things are, not how bad.
After all, the world’s population has more than tripled during this century, and world output has risen hugely, so you would expect the earth itself to have been affected. Indeed, if people lived, consumed and produced things in the same way as they did in 1900 (or 1950, or indeed 1980), the world by now would be a pretty disgusting place: smelly, dirty, toxic and dangerous.
But they don’t. The reasons why they don’t, and why the environment has not been mined, have to do with prices, technological innovation, social change and government regulation in response to popular pressure. That is why, today’s environmental problems in the poor countries ought, in principle, to be solvable.
Raw materials have not run out, and show no sign of doing so. Logically, one day they must: the planet is a finite place. Yet it is also very big, and man is very ingenious. What has happened is that every time a material seems to be running short, the price has risen and, in response, people have looked for new sources of supply, tried to find ways to use less of the material, or looked for a new substitute. For this reason prices for energy and for minerals have fallen in real terms during the century. The same is true for food. Prices fluctuate, in response to harvests, natural disasters and political instability; and when they rise, it takes some time before new sources of supply become available. But they always do, assisted by new farming and crop technology. The long term trend has been downwards.
It is where prices and markets do not operate properly that this benign (良性的) trend begins to stumble, and the genuine problems arise. Markets cannot always keep the environment healthy. If no one owns the resource concerned, no one has an interest in conserving it or fostering it: fish is the best example of this.
26.	According to the author, most students ________.
A) believe the world’s environment is in an undesirable condition
B) agree that the environment of the world is not as bad as it is thought to be
C) get high marks for their good knowledge of the world’s environment
D) appear somewhat unconcerned about the state of the world’s environment
27.	The huge increase in world production and population ________.
A) has made the world a worse place to live in
B) has had a positive influence on the environment
C) has not significantly affected the environment
D) has made the world a dangerous place to live in
28.	One of the reasons why the long-term trend of prices has been downwards is that ________.
A) technological innovation can promote social stability
B) political instability will cause consumption to drop
C) new farming and crop technology can lead to overproduction
D) new sources are always becoming available
29.	Fish resources are diminishing because ________.
A) no new substitutes can be found in large quantities
B) they are not owned by any particular entity
C) improper methods of fishing have mined the fishing grounds
D) water pollution is extremely serious
30.	The primary solution to environmental problems is ________.
A) to allow market forces to operate properly
B) to curb consumption of natural resources
C) to limit the growth of the world population
D) to avoid fluctuations in prices
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
About the time that schools and others quite reasonably became interested in seeing to it that all children, whatever their background, were fairly treated, intelligence testing became unpopular.
Some thought it was unfair to minority children. Through the past few decades such testing has gone out of fashion and many communities have indeed forbidden it.
However, paradoxically, just recently a group of black parents filed a lawsuit (诉讼) in California claiming that the state’s ban on IQ testing discriminates against their children by denying them the opportunity to take the test. (They believed, correctly, that IQ tests are a valid method of evaluating children for special education classes.) The judge, therefore, reversed, at least partially, his original decision.
And so the argument goes on and on. Does it benefit or harm children from minority groups to have their intelligence tested? We have always been on the side of permitting, even facilitating, such testing. If a child of any color or group is doing poorly in school it seems to us very important to know whether it is because he or she is of low intelligence, or whether some other factor is the cause.
What school and family can do to improve poor performance is influenced by its cause. It is not discriminative to evaluate either a child’s physical condition or his intellectual level.
Unfortunately, intellectual level seems to be a sensitive subject, and what the law allows us to do varies from time to time. The same fluctuation back and forth occurs in areas other than intelligence. Thirty years or so ago, for instance, white families were encouraged to adopt black children. It was considered discriminative not to do so.
And then the style changed and this cross-racial adopting became generally unpopular, and social agencies felt that black children should go to black families only. It is hard to say what are the best procedures. But surely good will on the part of all of us is needed.
As to intelligence, in our opinion, the more we know about any child’s intellectual level, the better for the child in question.
31.	Why did the intelligence test become unpopular in the past few decades?
A) Its validity was challenged by many communities.
B) It was considered discriminative against minority children.
C) It met with strong opposition from the majority of black parents.
D) It deprived the black children of their rights to a good education.
32.	The recent legal action taken by some black parents in California aimed to ________.
A) draw public attention to IQ testing
B) put an end to special education
C) remove the state’s ban on intelligence tests
D) have their children enter white schools
33.	The author believes that intelligence testing ________.
A) may ease racial confrontation in the United States
B) can encourage black children to keep up with white children
C) may seriously aggravate racial discrimination in the United States
D) can help black parents make decisions about their children’s education
34.	The author’s opinion of child adoption seems to be that ________.
A) no rules whatsoever can be prescribed
B) white families should adopt black children
C) adoption should be based on IQ test results
D) cross-racial adoption is to be advocated
35.	Child adoption is mentioned in the passage to show that ________.
A) good will may sometimes complicate racial problems
B) social surroundings are vital to the healthy growth of children
C) intelligence testing also applies to non-academic areas
D) American opinion can shift when it comes to sensitive issues
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Not too many decades ago it seemed “obvious” both to the general public and to sociologists that modern society has changed people’s natural relations, loosened their responsibilities to kin (亲戚) and neighbors, and substituted in their place superficial relationships with passing acquaintances. However, in recent years a growing body of research has revealed that the “obvious” is not true. It seems that if you are a city resident, you typically know a smaller proportion of your neighbors than you do if you are a resident of a smaller community. But, for the most part, this fact has few significant consequences. It does not necessarily follow that if you know few of your neighbors you will know no one else.
Even in very large cities, people maintain close social ties within small, private social worlds. Indeed, the number and quality of meaningful relationships do not differ between more and less urban people. Small-town residents are more involved with kin than are big-city residents. Yet city dwellers compensate by developing friendships with people who share similar interests and activities. Urbanism may produce a different style of life, but the quality of life does not differ between town and city. Nor are residents of large communities any likelier to display psychological symptoms of stress or alienation, a feeling of not belonging, than are residents of smaller communities. However, city dwellers do worry more about crime, and this leads them to a distrust of strangers.
These findings do not imply that urbanism makes little or no difference. If neighbors are strangers to one another, they are less likely to sweep the sidewalk of an elderly couple living next door or keep an eye out for young trouble makers. Moreover, as Wirth suggested, there may be a link between a community’s population size and its social heterogeneity (多样性). For instance, sociologists have found much evidence that the size of a community is associated with bad behavior including gambling, drugs, etc. Large-city urbanites are also more likely than their small-town counterparts to have a cosmopolitan (见多识广者的) outlook, to display less responsibility to traditional kinship roles, to vote for leftist political candidates, and to be tolerant of nontraditional religious groups, unpopular political groups, and so-called undesirables. Everything considered, heterogeneity and unusual behavior seem to be outcomes of large population size.
36.	Which of the following statements best describes the organization of the first paragraph?
A) Two contrasting views are presented.
B) An argument is examined and possible solutions given.
C) Research results concerning the quality of urban life are presented in order of time.
D) A detailed description of the difference between urban and small-town life is given.
37.	According to the passage, it was once a common belief that urban residents ________.
A) did not have the same interests as their neighbors
B) could not develop long-standing relationships
C) tended to be associated with bad behavior
D) usually had more friends
38.	One of the consequences of urban life is that impersonal relationships among neighbors ________.
A) disrupt people’s natural relations
B) make them worry about crime
C) cause them not to show concern for one another
D) cause them to be suspicious of each other
39.	It can be inferred from the passage that the bigger a community is, ________.
A) the better its quality of life
B) the more similar its interests
C) the more tolerant and open-minded it is
D) the likelier it is to display psychological symptoms of stress
40.	What is the passage mainly about?
A) Similarities in the interpersonal relationships between urbanites and small-town dwellers.
B) Advantages of living in big cities as compared with living in small towns.
C) The positive role that urbanism plays in modern life.
D) The strong feeling of alienation of city inhabitants.

Sporting activities are essentially modified forms of hunting behavior. Viewing biologically, the modern (S1) footballer is revealed as a member of a disguised hunting pack. His killing weapon has turned into a harmless football and his prey into a goal-mouth. If his aim is inaccurate and he (S2) scores a goal, enjoys the hunter’s triumph of killing his prey. (S3)
To understand how this transformation has taken place we must briefly look up at our ancient ancestors. They spent over a (S4) million year evolving as co-operative hunters. Their very survival (S5) depended on success in the hunting-field. Under this pressure their whole way of life, even if their bodies, became radically (S6) changed. They became chasers, runners, jumpers, aimers, throwers and prey-killers. They co-operate as skillful male-group (S7) attackers.
Then, about ten thousand years ago, when this immensely (S8) long formative period of hunting for food, they became farmers.
Their improved intelligence, so vital to their old hunting life, were put to a new use-that of penning ( 把 ...... 关在圈中), (S9) controlling and domesticating their prey. The food was there on the farms, awaiting their needs. The risks and uncertainties of farming were no longer essential for survival. (S10)

Passage 1
Nilrikman and others of the halfway research group have done some research into the differences between average and good negotiators. They found negotiators with the good trait record and studied them in action. They compared them with another group of average negotiators and found that there was no difference in the time that the two groups spent on planning their strategy. However, there were some significant differences on other points. The average negotiators thought in terms of the present, but the good negotiators took a long-time review. They made lots of suggestions and considered twice the number of the alternatives. The average negotiators set their objectives as single points. We hope to get two dollars, for example. The good negotiators set their objectives in terms of range, which they might formulate as “We hope to get two dollars, but if we get one dollar and fifty, it will be all right.”. The average negotiators tried to persuade by giving lots of reasons. They use a lot of different arguments. The good negotiators didn’t give many reasons. They just repeated the same ones. They also did more summarizing and reviewing, checking they were understood correctly.
11.	What do good negotiators and average negotiators have in common?
12.	According to the speaker, what would good negotiators do?
13.	According to the speaker, what does the average negotiator usually do?
Passage 2
To most of us sharks are the most dangerous fish in the sea and they attack humans. However, according to Doctor Clark, who has studied the behavior of sharks for twelve years, humans are not normally on the shark’s menu. What do sharks feed on, mainly fish and other sea animals? Doctor Clark also found that sharks don’t eat as much food as people think. For instance, a nine-year-old shark only needs two pound of food a day to keep healthy. But she says, sharks sometimes starve and at other times they fill themselves with what they have killed. Around the world, there are only about one hundred shark attacks on humans each year, ten of which proved fatal. But consider this, in the US alone, about three million people are bitten by dogs each year. Of these, thirty people die. If sharks bite you, says Doctor Clark, the reason is usually because it mistakes you for natural food. For example, say you went underwater-fishing and saw a shark, you could be in trouble. The shark might go for the injured fish you had attacked and take a bite of you at the same time. If you go into a shark’s territory and threaten it, it might try to bite you. That’s because sharks are territorial and tend to guard their territory. Like dogs, they protect the area they think is their own.
14.	What does the passage say about the eating behavior of sharks?
15.	When might a shark attach humans?
16.	What do we learn from the passage about sharks?
Passage 3
Science fiction writers have often imagined humans going to live on the Mars. But these days, scientists are taking the idea seriously. It has a great deal to recommend it, since it might solve the problem of overcrowding on the earth. But obviously, it would not be worth making the effort unless people could live there naturally. If the atmosphere were like that of the earth, this might be possible. But in fact it is mostly carbon dioxide. Apart from that, there are other problems to be overcome. For example, the temperature would have to be raised from 6 degrees below zero to 15 degrees above it. Scientists who study Mars have laid down the program that they can follow. To begin with, they will have to find out whether life has ever existed on the planet of Mars in the past. Secondly they will have to make a reliable map of its surface. And finally, they will have to make a list of the gases. Above all, they will have to discover how much nitrogen it possesses. Since nitrogen is four fifths of the air we breathe, they are surprising optimistic about raising the temperature on Mars and believe it could be down in hundred years. It will take a bit longer, though, to transform the atmosphere so that human beings could live there. Scientists estimate this will take one hundred thousand years.
17.	Why are scientists interested in Mars?
18.	What is the one of the things that must be done if a man can live on Mars?
19.	Why do scientist want to find out whether there is sufficient nitrogen on Mars?
20.	What is the prospect of people living on Mars?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
When global warming finally came, it stuck with a vengeance (异乎寻常地). In some regions, temperatures rose several degrees in less than a century. Sea levels shot up nearly 400 feet, flooding coastal settlements and forcing people to migrate inland. Deserts spread throughout the world as vegetation shifted drastically in North America, Europe and Asia. After driving many of the animals around them to near extinction, people were forced to abandon their old way of life for a radically new survival strategy that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. The adaptation was farming: the global-warming crisis that gave rise to it happened more than 10,000 years ago.
As environmentalists convene in Rio de Janeiro this week to ponder the global climate of the future, earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in understanding how climate has changed in the past—and how those changes have transformed human existence. Researchers have begun to piece together an illuminating picture of the powerful geological and astronomical forces that have combined to change the planet’s environment from hot to cold, wet to dry and back again over a time period stretching back hundreds of millions of years.
Most importantly, scientists are beginning to realize that the climatic changes have had a major impact on the evolution of the human species. New research now suggests that climate shifts have played a key role in nearly every significant turning point in human evolution: from the dawn of primates (灵长目动物) some 65 million years ago to human ancestors rising up to walk on two legs, from the huge expansion of the human brain to the rise of agriculture. Indeed, the human history has not been merely touched by global climate change, some scientists argue, it has in some instances been driven by it.
The new research has profound implications for the environmental summit in Rio. Among other things, the findings demonstrate that dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The benign (宜人的) global environment that has existed over the past 10,000 years—during which agriculture, writing, cities and most other features of civilization appeared—is a mere bright spot in a much larger pattern of widely varying climate over the ages. In fact, the pattern of climate change in the past reveals that Earth’s climate will almost certainly go through dramatic changes in the future—even without the influence of human activity.
21.	Farming emerged as a survival strategy because man had been obliged ________.
A) to give up his former way of life
B) to leave the coastal areas
C) to follow the ever-shifting vegetation
D) to abandon his original settlement
22.	Earth scientists have come to understand that climate ________.
A) is going through a fundamental change
B) has been getting warmer for 10,000 years
C) will eventually change from hot to cold
D) has gone through periodical changes
23.	Scientists believe that human evolution ________.
A) has seldom been accompanied by climatic changes
B) has exerted little influence on climatic changes
C) has largely been effected by climatic changes
D) has had a major impact on climatic changes
24.	Evidence of past climatic changes indicates that ________.
A) human activities have accelerated changes of Earth’s environment
B) Earth’s environment will remain mild despite human interference
C) Earth’s climate is bound to change significantly in the future
D) Earth’s climate is unlikely to undergo substantial changes in the future
25.	The message the author wishes to convey in the passage is that ________.
A) human civilization remains glorious though it is affected by climatic changes
B) mankind is virtually helpless in the face of the dramatic changes of climate
C) man has to limit his activities to slow down the global warming process
D) human civilization will continue to develop in spite of the changes of nature
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Now woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to the late Duchess (公爵夫人) of Windsor embodies much of the odd spirit of our times. Being thin is deemed as such a virtue.
The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better—or worse—part of my life. Being rich wouldn’t be bad either, but that won’t happen unless an unknown relative dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars.
Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin, and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not repellent? All religions have certain days when people refrain from eating, and excessive eating is one of Christianity’s seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable salvation and high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being.
Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat—or even only somewhat overweight—is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength.
Our obsession (迷恋) with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that, in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem—too much fat and a lack of fiber—than a weight problem.
The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much attention to weight. Simply being thin is not enough. It is actually hazardous if those who get (or already are) thin think they are automatically healthy and thus free from paying attention to their overall life-style. Thinness can be pure vainglory (虚荣).
26.	In the eyes of the author, an odd phenomenon nowadays is that ________.
A) the Duchess of Windsor is regarded as a woman of virtue
B) looking slim is a symbol of having a large fortune
C) being thin is viewed as a much desired quality
D) religious people are not necessarily virtuous
27.	Swept by the prevailing trend, the author ________.
A) had to go on a diet for the greater part of her life
B) could still prevent herself from going off the track
C) had to seek help from rich distant relatives
D) had to wear highly fashionable clothes
28.	In human history, people’s views on body weight ________.
A) were closely related to their religious beliefs
B) changed from time to time
C) varied between the poor and the rich
D) led to different moral standards
29.	The author criticizes women’s obsession with thinness ________.
A) from an economic and educational perspective
B) from sociological and medical points of view
C) from a historical and religious standpoint
D) in the light of moral principles
30.	What’s the author’s advice to women who are absorbed in the idea of thinness?
A) They should be more concerned with their overall lifestyle.
B) They should be more watchful for fatal diseases.
C) They should gain weight to look healthy.
D) They should rid themselves of fantasies about designer clothes.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
War may be a natural expression of biological instincts and drives toward aggression in the human species. Natural impulses of anger, hostility, and territoriality (守卫地盘的天性) are expressed through acts of violence. These are all qualities that humans share with animals. Aggression is a kind of innate (天生的) survival mechanism, an instinct for self-preservation that allows animals to defend themselves from threats to their existences of human violence are always conditioned by social conventions that give shape to aggressive behavior. In human societies violence has a social function. It is a strategy for creating or destroying forms of social order. Religious traditions have taken a leading role in directing the powers of violence. We will look at the ritual and ethical (道德上的) patterns within which human violence has been directed.
The violence within a society is controlled through institutions of law. The more developed a legal system becomes, the more society takes responsibility for the discovery, control, and punishment of violent acts. In most tribal societies the only means to deal with an act of violence is revenge. Each family group may have the responsibility for personally carrying out judgment and punishment upon the person who committed the offense. But in legal systems, the responsibility for revenge becomes depersonalized and diffused. The society assumes the responsibility for protecting individuals from violence. In cases where they cannot be protected, the society is responsible for imposing punishment. In a state controlled legal system, individuals are removed from the cycle of revenge motivated by acts of violence, and the state assumes responsibility for their protection.
The other side of a state legal apparatus is a state military apparatus. While the one protects the individual from violence, the other sacrifices the individual to violence in the interests of the state. In war the state affirms its supreme power over the individuals within its own borders. War is not simply a trial by combating to settle disputes between states; it is the moment when the state makes its most powerful demands upon its people for their commitment allegiance, and supreme sacrifice. Times of war test a community’s deepest religious and ethical commitments.
31.	Human violence shows evidence of being a learned behavior in that ________.
A) it threatens the existing social systems
B) it is influenced by society
C) it has roots in religious conflicts
D) it is directed against institutions of law
32.	The function of legal systems, according to the passage, is ________.
A) to control violence within a society
B) to protect the world from chaos
C) to free society from the idea of revenge
D) to give the government absolute power
33.	What does the author mean by saying “... in legal systems, the responsibility for revenge becomes depersonalized and diffused” (Lines 4-5, Para. 2)?
A) Legal systems greatly reduce the possibilities of physical violence.
B) Offenses against individuals are no longer judged on a personal basis.
C) Victims of violence find it more difficult to take revenge.
D) Punishment is not carried out directly by the individuals involved.
34.	The word “allegiance” (Line 4, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to ________.
A) loyalty
B) objective
C) survival
D) motive
35.	What can we learn from the last paragraph?
A) Governments tend to abuse their supreme power in times of war.
B) In times of war governments may extend their power across national borders.
C) In times of war governments impose high religious and ethical standards on their people.
D) Governments may sacrifice individuals in the interests of the state in times of war.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Researchers who are unfamiliar with the cultural and ethnic groups they are studying must take extra precautions to shed any biases they bring with them from their own culture. For example, they must make sure they construct measures that are meaningful for each of the cultural or ethnic minority groups being studied.
In conducting research on cultural and ethnic minority issues, investigators distinguish between the emic approach and the etic approach. In the emic approach, the goal is to describe behavior in one culture or ethnic group in terms that are meaningful and important to the people in that culture or ethnic group, without regard to other cultures or ethnic groups. In the etic approach, the goal is to describe behavior so that generalizations can be made across cultures. If researchers construct a questionnaire in anemic fashion, the concern is only that the questions are meaningful to the particular culture or ethnic group being studied. If, however, the researchers construct a questionnaire in an etic fashion, they want to include questions that reflect concepts familiar to all cultures involved.
How might the emic and etic approaches be reflected in the study of family processes? In the emic approach, the researchers might choose to focus only on middle-class White families, without regard for whether the information obtained in the study can be generalized or is appropriate for ethnic minority groups. In a subsequent study, the researchers may decide to adopt an etic approach by studying not only middle-class White families, but also lower-income White families, Black American families, Spanish American families, and Asian American families. In studying ethnic minority families, the researchers would likely discover that the extended family is more frequently a support system in ethnic minority families than in White American families. If so, the emic approach would reveal a different pattern of family interaction than would the etic approach, documenting that research with middle-class White families cannot always be generalized to all ethnic groups.
36.	According to the first paragraph, researchers unfamiliar with the target cultures are inclined to ________.
A) be overcautious in constructing meaningful measures
B) view them from their own cultural perspective
C) guard against interference from their own culture
D) accept readily what is alien to their own culture
37.	What does the author say about the emic approach and the etic approach?
A) They have different research focuses in the study of ethnic issues.
B) The former is biased while the latter is objective.
C) The former concentrates on the study of culture while the latter on family issues.
D) They are both heavily dependent on questionnaires in conducting surveys.
38.	Compared with the etic approach, the emic approach is apparently more ________.
A) culturally interactive
B) culturally biased
C) culture-oriented
D) culture-specific
39.	The etic approach is concerned with ________.
A) the general characteristics of minority families
B) culture-related concepts of individual ethnic groups
C) features shared by various cultures or ethnic groups
D) the economic conditions of different types of families
40.	Which of the following is true of the ethnic minority families in the ________ U.S. according to the passage?
A) Their cultural patterns are usually more adaptable.
B) Their cultural concepts are difficult to comprehend.
C) They don’t interact with each other so much as White families.
D) They have closer family ties than White families.

A great many cities are experiencing difficulties which are nothing new in the history of cities, except in their scale.
Some cities have lost their original purpose and have not found new one. And any large or rich city is going to attract poor (S1) immigrants, who flood in, filling with hopes of prosperity (S2) which are then often disappointing. There are backward towns on the edge of Bombay or Brasilia, just as though there were (S3) on the edge of seventeenth-century London or early nineteenth century Paris. This is new is in the scale. Descriptions (S4) written by eighteenth-century travelers of the poor of Mexico City, and the enormous contrasts that was to be found there, (S5) are very dissimilar to descriptions of Mexico City today—the (S6) poor can still be numbered in millions.
The whole monstrous growth rests on economic prosperity, but behind it lies two myths: the myth of the city as a (S7) promised land, that attracts immigrants from rural poverty (S8) and brings it flooding into city centers, and the myth of the (S9) country as a Garden of Eden, which, a few generations late, (S10) sends them flooding out again to the suburbs.

Student Use of Computers
Students tend to use computers more nowadays. Reading this chart, we can find that the average number of hours a student spends on the computer per week has increased sharply. In 1990, it was less than 2 hours; and in 1995, it increased to almost 4 hours, and in 2000, the number soared to 20 hours.
Obviously computers are becoming more and more popular. There are several reasons for this. First, computers facilitate us in more aspects of life. Also, the fast development of the Internet enlarges our demands for using computers, we can easily contact with friends in remote places through the Internet. Besides, the prices of computers are getting lower and lower, which enables more students to purchase them.
However, there still exist some problem, such as, poor quality, out-of-date designs and so on. And how to balance the time between using computers and studying is also a serious problem.
Anyhow, we will benefit a lot from computers as long as we use them properly.

The decade for natural disaster reduction is a programme designed to reduce the impact of natural disasters throughout the world. With the support from the UN, countries will be encouraged to share information about disaster reduction, for instance, information about how to plan for and cope with hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. One of the most important things the programme plans to do is to remind us of what we can do to protect ourselves. For example, we can pack a suitcase with flashlights, a radio, food, drinking water and some tools. This safety case may help us survive disaster until help arrives. Besides, the programmes will encourage governments to establish building standards, emergency response plan and training plans. These measures can help to limit the destruction by natural disasters. The comparatively mild-effects of the northern California earthquake in 1989, are good evidence that we do have the technology to prevent vast destruction. The recent disasters, on the other hand, prove that people will suffer if we don’t use that technology. When a highway collapsed in northern California, people were killed in their cars. The highway was not built according to stricter standards to resist earthquakes. Individuals and governments have to be far-sighted. We should take extra time and spend extra money to build disaster safety into our lives. Although such programme can’t hold back the winds or stop earthquakes, they can save people’s lives and homes.
15.	What is the purpose of the programme mentioned in this passage?
16.	What can we learn from the northern California earthquake in 1989?
17.	Why did the highway in northern California collapse?
Passage Three
Living at the foot of one of the most active volcanoes might not appeal to you at all. But believe it or not, the area surrounding Mount Etna in Italy is packed with people. In fact, it is the most densely-populated region on the whole island of Sicily. The reason is that rich volcanic soil makes the land fantastic for farming. By growing and selling a variety of crops, local people earn a good living.
For them, the economic benefit they reap surpasses the risk of dying or losing property in one of volcanoes frequent eruptions. People everywhere make decisions about risky situations this way, that is, by comparing the risks and the benefits. According to the experts, the size of the risks depends on both its probability and seriousness. Let’s take Mount Etna for example, it does erupt frequently
, but thousands of the eruptions are usually minor, so the overall risk for people living nearby is relatively small. But suppose Mount Etna erupted every day, or imagine that each eruption there killed thousands of people, if that were the case, the risk would be much larger. Indeed, the risk would be too large for many people to live with and they would have to move away.
18.	How do people make decisions about risky situations?
19.	What do we know about Mount Etna from the passage?
20.	What will people living near Mount Etna do in the face of its eruptions?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft chairman without a single earned university degree, is by his success raising new doubts about the worth of the business world’s favorite academic title: the MBA (Master of Business Administration).
The MBA, a 20th-century product, always has borne the mark of lowly commerce and greed (贪婪) on the tree-lined campuses ruled by purer disciplines such as philosophy and literature.
But even with the recession apparently cutting into the hiring of business school graduates, about 79,000 people are expected to receive MBAs in 1993. This is nearly 16 times the number of business graduates in 1960, a testimony to the wide spread assumption that the MBA is vital for young men and women who want to run companies some day.
“If you are going into the corporate world it is still a disadvantage not to have one,” said Donald Morrison, professor of marketing and management science. “But in the last five years or so, when someone says, ‘Should I attempt to get an MBA,’ the answer a lot more is: It depends.”
The success of Bill Gates and other non-MBAs, such as the late Sam Walton of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has helped inspire self-conscious debates on business school campuses over the worth of a business degree and whether management skills can be taught.
The Harvard Business Review printed a lively, fictional exchange of letters to dramatize complaints about business degree holders.
The article called MBA hires “extremely disappointing” and said “MBAs want to move up too fast, they don’t understand politics and people, and they aren’t able to function as part of a team until their third year. But by then, they’re out looking for other jobs.”
The problem, most participants in the debate acknowledge, is that the MBA has acquired an aura (光环) of future riches and power far beyond its actual importance and usefulness.
Enrollment in business schools exploded in the 1970s and 1980s and created the assumption that no one who pursued a business career could do without one. The growth was fueled by a backlash (反冲) against the anti-business values of the 1960s and by the women’s movement.
Business people who have hired or worked with MBAs say those with the degrees of ten know how to analyze systems but are not so skillful at motivating people. “They don’t get a lot of grounding in the people side of the business”, said James Shaffer, vice-president and principal of the Towers Perrin management consulting firm.
21.	According to Paragraph 2, what is the general attitude towards business on campuses dominated by purer disciplines?
A) Scornful.
B) Appreciative.
C) Envious.
D) Realistic.
22.	It seems that the controversy over the value of MBA degrees had been fueled mainly by ________.
A) the complaints from various employers
B) the success of many non-MBAs
C) the criticism from the scientists of purer disciplines
D) the poor performance of MBAs at work
23.	What is the major weakness of MBA holders according to the Harvard Business Review?
A) They are usually self-centered.
B) They are aggressive and greedy.
C) They keep complaining about their jobs.
D) They are not good at dealing with people.
24.	From the passage we know that most MBAs ________.
A) can climb the corporate ladder fairly quickly
B) quit their jobs once they are familiar with their workmates
C) receive salaries that do not match their professional training
D) cherish unrealistic expectations about their future
25.	What is the passage mainly about?
A) Why there is an increased enrollment in MBA programs.
B) The necessity of reforming MBA programs in business schools.
C) Doubts about the worth of holding an MBA degree.
D) A debate held recently on university campuses.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
When school officials in Kalkaska, Michigan, closed classes last week, the media flocked to the story, portraying the town’s 2,305 students as victims of stingy (吝啬的) taxpayers. There is some truth to that; the property-tax rate here is one-third lower than the state average. But shutting their schools also allowed Kalkask’s educators and the state’s largest teachers’ union, the Michigan Education Association, to make a political point. Their aim was to spur passage of legislation Michigan lawmakers are debating to increase the state’s share of school funding.
It was no coincidence that Kalkaska shut its schools two weeks after residents rejected a 28 percent property-tax increase. The school board argued that without the increase it lacked the $1.5 million needed to keep schools open.
But the school system had not done all it could to keep the schools open. Officials declined to borrow against next year’s state aid, they refused to trim extra curricular activities and they did not consider seeking a smaller—perhaps more acceptable—tax increase. In fact, closing early is costing Kalkaska a significant amount, including $600,000 in unemployment payments to teachers and staff and $250,000 in lost state aid. In February, the school system promised teachers and staff two months of retirement payments in case schools closed early, a deal that will cost the district $275,000 more.
Other signs suggest school authorities were at least as eager to make a political statement as to keep schools open. The Michigan Education Association hired a public relations firm to stage a rally marking the school closing, which attracted 14 local and national television stations and networks. The president of the National Education Association, the MEA’s parent organization, flew from Washington, D. C., for the event. And the union tutored school officials in the art of television interviews. School supervisor Doyle Disbrow acknowledges the district could have kept schools open by cutting programs but denies the moves were politically motivated.
Michigan lawmakers have reacted angrily to the closings. The state Senate has al ready voted to put the system into receivership (破产管理) and reopen schools immediately; the Michigan House plans to consider the bill this week.
26.	We learn from the passage that schools in Kalkaska, Michigan, are funded ________.
A) by both the local and state governments
B) exclusively by the local government
C) mainly by the state government
D) by the National Education Association
27.	One of the purposes for which school officials closed classes was ________.
A) to avoid paying retirement benefits to teachers and staff
B) to draw the attention of local taxpayers to political issues
C) to make the financial difficulties of their teachers and staff known to the public
D) to pressure Michigan lawmakers into increasing state funds for local schools
28.	The author seems to disapprove of ________.
A) the Michigan lawmakers’ endless debating
B) the shutting of schools in Kalkaska
C) the involvement of the mass media
D) delaying the passage of the school funding legislation
29.	We learn from the passage that school authorities in Kalkaska are concerned about ________.
A) a raise in the property-tax rate in Michigan
B) reopening the schools there immediately
C) the attitude of the MEA’s parent organization
D) making a political issue of the closing of the schools
30.	According to the passage, the closing of the schools developed into a crisis because of ________.
A) the complexity of the problem
B) the political motives on the part of the educators
C) the weak response of the state officials
D) the strong protest on the part of the students’ parents
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
German Chancellor (首相) Otto Von Bismarck may be most famous for his military and diplomatic talent, but his legacy (遗产) includes many of today’s social insurance programs. During the middle of the 19th century, Germany, along with other European nations, experienced an unprecedented rash of workplace deaths and accidents as a result of growing industrialization. Motivated in part by Christian compassion (怜悯) for the helpless as well as a practical political impulse to undercut the support of the socialist labor movement, Chancellor Bismarck created the world’s first workers’ compensation law in 1884.
By 1908, the United States was the only industrial nation in the world that lacked workers’ compensation insurance. America’s injured workers could sue for damages in a court of law, but they still faced a number of tough legal barriers. For example, employees had to prove that their injuries directly resulted from employer negligence and that they themselves were ignorant about potential hazards in the workplace. The first state workers’ compensation law in this country passed in 1911, and the program soon spread throughout the nation.
After World War II, benefit payments to American workers did not keep up with the cost of living. In fact, real benefit levels were lower in the 1970s than they were in the 1940s, and in most states the maximum benefit was below the poverty level for a family of four. In 1970, President Richard Nixon set up a national commission to study the problems of workers’ compensation. Two years later, the commission issued 19 key recommendations, including one that called for increasing compensation benefit levels to 100 percent of the states’ average weekly wages.
In fact, the average compensation benefit in America has climbed from 55 percent of the states’ average weekly wages in 1972 to 97 percent today. But, as most studies show, every 10 percent increase in compensation benefits results in a 5 per cent increase in the numbers of workers who file for claims. And with so much more money floating in the workers’ compensation system, it’s not surprising that doctors and lawyers have helped themselves to a large slice of the growing pie.
31.	The world’s first workers’ compensation law was introduced by Bismarck ________.
A) to make industrial production safer
B) to speed up the pace of industrialization
C) out of religious and political considerations
D) for fear of losing the support of the socialist labor movement
32.	We learn from the passage that the process of industrialization in Europe ________.
A) was accompanied by an increased number of workshop accidents
B) resulted in the development of popular social insurance programs
C) required workers to be aware of the potential dangers at the workplace
D) met growing resistance from laborers working at machines
33.	One of the problems the American injured workers faced in getting compensation in the early 19th century was that ________.
A) they had to have the courage to sue for damages in a court of law
B) different states in the U.S. had totally different compensation programs
C) America’s average compensation benefit was much lower than the cost of living
D) they had to produce evidence that their employers were responsible for the accident
34.	After 1972 workers’ compensation insurance in the U.S. became more favorable to workers so that ________.
A) the poverty level for a family of four went up drastically
B) there were fewer legal barriers when they filed for claims
C) the number of workers suing for damages increased
D) more money was allocated to their compensation system
35.	The author ends the passage with the implication that ________.
A) compensation benefits in America are soaring to new heights
B) the workers are not the only ones to benefit from the compensation system
C) people from all walks of life can benefit from the compensation system
D) money floating in the compensation system is a huge drain on the U.S. economy
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Early in the age of affluence (富裕) that followed World War II, an American retailing analyst named Victor Lebow proclaimed, “Our enormously productive economy... We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever increasing rate.”
Americans have responded to Lebow’s call, and much of the world has followed.
Consumption has become a central pillar of life in industrial lands and is even embedded in social values. Opinion surveys in the world’s two largest economies—Japan and the United States—show consumerist definitions of success becoming ever prevalent.
Overconsumption by the world’s fortunate is an environmental problem unmatched in severity by anything but perhaps population growth. Their surging exploitation of resources threatens to exhaust or unalterably spoil forests, soils, water, air and climate.
Ironically, high consumption may be a mixed blessing in human terms, too. The time-honored values of integrity of character, good work, friendship, family and community have often been sacrificed in the rush to riches.
Thus many in the industrial lands have a sense that their world of plenty is somehow hollow—that, misled by a consumerist culture, they have been fruitlessly attempting to satisfy what are essentially social, psychological and spiritual needs with material things.
Of course, the opposite of over-consumption—poverty—is no solution to either environmental or human problems. It is infinitely worse for people and bad for the natural world too. Dispossessed (被剥夺得一无所有的) peasants slash-and-burn their way into the rain forests of Latin America, and hungry nomads (游牧民族) turn their herds out onto fragile African grassland, reducing it to desert.
If environmental destruction results when people have either too little or too much, we are left to wonder how much is enough. What level of consumption can the earth support? When does having more cease to add noticeably to human satisfaction?
36.	The emergence of the affluent society after World War II ________.
A) gave birth to a new generation of upper class consumers
B) gave rise to the dominance of the new egoism
C) led to the reform of the retailing system
D) resulted in the worship of consumerism
37.	Apart from enormous productivity, another important impetus to high consumption is ________.
A) the conversion of the sale of goods into rituals
B) the people’s desire for a rise in their living standards
C) the imbalance that has existed between production and consumption
D) the concept that one’s success is measured by how much they consume
38.	Why does the author say high consumption is a mixed blessing?
A) Because poverty still exists in an affluent society.
B) Because moral values are sacrificed in pursuit of material satisfaction.
C) Because overconsumption won’t last long due to unrestricted population growth.
D) Because traditional rituals are often neglected in the process of modernization.
39.	According to the passage, consumerist culture ________.
A) cannot thrive on a fragile economy
B) will not aggravate environmental problems
C) cannot satisfy human spiritual needs
D) will not alleviate poverty in wealthy countries
40.	It can be inferred from the passage that ________.
A) human spiritual needs should match material affluence
B) there is never an end to satisfying people’s material needs
C) whether high consumption should be encouraged is still an issue
D) how to keep consumption at a reasonable level remains a problem

Section B
Passage One
There are some serious problems in the Biramichi river. The local chamber of commerce, which represents the industry in the area, hired me as a consultant to do a one year study on fishing in the Biramichi river and write a rep ort for them. This is my report:
One of the major problems in the Biramichi river is that the level of oxygen in the water is too low. Several chemicals have displaced the oxygen. This chemical pollution has two sources: the factories which dump polluted water directly into the river and the local community which dumps untreated human wastes into the river. The local town government has already spent 2 million dollars on waste water treatment projects, but it will cost another 27 million to complete the projects. It will take at least 15 years for the town to collect enough revenue from taxes to complete these projects. The factories here employ 17,000 people in an area where there is very little alternative employment. It is not economically practical to close or relocate the factories. Also the factories cannot afford to finance chemical treatment plants by themselves. Another problem is that the members of the Biramichi fishing cooperative are overfishing. Fishes are caught when they are on the way upstream to lay eggs. Consequently, not enough fish are left to reproduce in large number. The members of cooperative say that they had already reduced their annual catch by 50 percent. However, my studies indicate that they took fewer fish because there were fewer fish to catch, not because they were trying to preserve fishes.
11.	What was the speaker assigned to do in the past year?
12.	What is one of the problems in the Biramichi river?
13.	What does the passage tell us about the factories along the river?
14.	Why was the annual catch of fish in the Biramichi river reduced according to the speaker?
Passage Two
Everybody has to die someday, but nobody likes to think about it. Even so, at sometime in their lives, most people manage to think about the question of how to make a will. If you have already made yours, it is probably just a few pages of writing, stating that you wish to leave everything to your family. That is the kind of will that the majority of people make. However, there are plenty of ways to make your will more interesting if you want to. To begin with, you don’t have to write it on paper. One man wrote his will on an envelope, another on the door, and a third on an egg. For some people, the most important part of their will is the part that says how they want to be buried. Mrs. Sandra West, a rich widow from Texas, decided that she wanted to be buried with her favorite car. In 1973, Mr. Green, a dentist from England, left most of his money to the nurse who worked for him if in 5 years she would not wear any kind of make-up or jewel or go out with men. Finally, let’s hope that your will is not like that of Dr. Wagner, who lived in America 100 years ago. His family, who had not been to see him for years, suddenly began to visit him when he became ill. What was worse, each person suggested to Dr. Wagner that they would like something to remember him by when he died. Greatly annoyed with them, Dr. Wagner wrote a will that would do this: to each of his four brothers, he left one of his legs or arms, his nephew got his nose and his two nieces each got an ear. His teeth went to his cousin. Then he set aside 1,000 dollars to pay for cutting his body and the rest of his money he left to the poor.
15.	What kind of will do most people leave behind according to the passage?
16.	What did the nurse have to do before getting the money left by the English dentist?
17.	Why did Dr. Wagner make an unusual will?
Passage Three
In recent years, there has been an unusually large number of divorces in the United States. In the past, when two people married each other, they intended to stay together for life. While today, many people marry believing that they can always get it divorce if the marriage does not work out. In the past, a large majority of the Americans frowned at the idea of divorce. Furthermore, many people believed that getting a divorce was a luxury that only the rich could afford. Indeed, getting a divorce was very expensive. However, since so many people have began to take a more casual view of marriage, it is interesting to know that the cost of get ting a divorce is lower. In fact, wherever you go in the United States today, it is not unusual to see newspaper ads that provide information on how and where to get a cheap divorce. Hollywood has always been known as the divorce capital of the world. The divorce rate among the movie stars is so high that it is difficult to know who is married to whom. Today many movie stars change husbands and wives as though they were changing clothes. Until marriage again become the serious and important part of people’s lives, we will probably continue to see a high rate of divorce.
18.	What did many Americans think of divorce in the past?
19.	What is the attitude of many Americans to marriage today?
20.	In the speaker’s view, when will the high rate of divorce be brought down?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In the villages of the English countryside there are still people who remember the good old days when no one bothered to lock their doors. There simply wasn’t any crime to worry about.
Amazingly, these happy times appear still to be with us in the world’s biggest community. A new study by Dan Farmer, a gifted programmer, using an automated investigative program of his own called SATAN, shows that the owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors.
SATAN can try out a variety of well-known hacking (黑客的) tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in. Farmer has made the program publicly available, amid much criticism. A person with evil intent could use it to hunt down sites that are easy to burgle (闯入…...行窃).
But Farmer is very concerned about the need to alert the public to poor security and, so far, events have proved him right. SATAN has done more to alert people to the risks than cause new disorder. So is the Net becoming more secure? Far from it. In the early days, when you visited a Web site your browser simply looked at the content. Now the Web is full of tiny programs that automatically download when you look at a Web page, and run on your own machine. These programs could, if their authors wished, do all kinds of nasty things to your computer.
At the same time, the Net is increasingly populated with spiders, worms, agents and other types of automated beasts designed to penetrate the sites and seek out and classify information. All these make wonderful tools for antisocial people who want to invade weak sites and cause damage.
But let’s look on the bright side. Given the lack of locks, the Internet is surely the world’s biggest (almost) crime-free society. Maybe that is because hackers are fundamentally honest. Or that there currently isn’t much to steal. Or because vandalism ( 恶意破坏) isn’t much fun unless you have a peculiar dislike for someone.
Whatever the reason, let’s enjoy it while we can. But expect it all to change, and security to become the number one issue, when the most influential inhabitants of the Net are selling services they want to be paid for.
21.	By saying “... owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors” (Lines 3-4, Para. 2), the author means that ________.
A) those happy times appear still to be with us
B) there simply wasn’t any crime to worry about
C) many sites are not well-protected
D) hackers try out tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in
22.	SATAN, a program designed by Dan Fanner can be used ________.
A) to investigate the security of Internet sites
B) to improve the security of the Internet system
C) to prevent hackers from breaking into websites
D) to download useful programs and information
23.	Fanner’s program has been criticized by the public because.
A) it causes damage to Net browsers
B) it can break into Internet sites
C) it can be used to cause disorder on all sites
D) it can be used by people with evil intent
24.	The author’s attitude toward SATAN is ________.
A) enthusiastic
B) critical
C) positive
D) indifferent
25.	The author suggests in the last paragraph that ________.
A) we should make full use of the Internet before security measures are strengthened
B) we should alert the most influential businessmen to the importance of security
C) influential businessmen should give priority to the improvement of Net security
D) net inhabitants should not let security measures affect their joy of surfing the Internet
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
I came away from my years of teaching on the college and university level with a conviction that enactment (扮演角色), performance, dramatization are the most successful forms of teaching. Students must be incorporated, made, so far as possible, an integral part of the learning process. The notion that learning should have in it an element of inspired play would seem to the greater part of the academic establishment merely silly, but that is nonetheless the case. Of Ezekiel Cheever, the most famous schoolmaster of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, his onetime student Cotton Mather wrote that he so planned his lessons that his pupils “came to work as though they came to play,” and Alfred North Whitehead, almost three hundred years later, noted that a teacher should make his/her students “glad they were there.”
Since, we are told, 80 to 90 percent of all instruction in the typical university is by the lecture method, we should give close attention to this form of education. There is, I think, much truth in Patricia Nelson Limerick’s observation that “lecturing is an unnatural act, an act for which God did not design humans. It is perfectly all right, now and then, for a human to be possessed by the urge to speak, and to speak while others remain silent. But to do this regularly, one hour and 15 minutes at a time... for one person to drag on while others sit in silence?... I do not believe that this is what the Creator... designed humans to do.”
The strange, almost incomprehensible fact is that many professors, just as they feel obliged to write dully, believe that they should lecture dully. To show enthusiasm is to risk appearing unscientific, unobjective; it is to appeal to the students’ emotions rather than their intellect. Thus the ideal lecture is one filled with facts and read in an unchanged monotone.
The cult (推崇) of lecturing dully, like the cult of writing dully, goes back, of course, some years. Edward Shils, professor of sociology, recalls the professors he encountered at the University of Pennsylvania in his youth. They seemed “a priesthood, rather uneven in their merits but uniform in their bearing; they never referred to anything personal. Some read from old lecture notes and then haltingly explained the thumb-worn last lines. Others lectured from cards that had served for years, to judge by the worn edges... The teachers began on time, ended on time, and left the room without saying a word more to their students, very seldom being detained by questioners... The classes were not large, yet there was no discussion. No questions were raised in class, and there were no office hours.”
26.	The author believes that a successful teacher should be able to ________.
A) make dramatization an important aspect of students’ learning
B) make inspired play an integral part of the learning process
C) improve students’ learning performance
D) make study just as easy as play
27.	The majority of university professors prefer the traditional way of lecturing in the belief that ________.
A) it draws the close attention of the students
B) it conforms in a way to the design of the Creator
C) it presents course content in a scientific and objective manner
D) it helps students to comprehend abstract theories more easily
28.	What the author recommends in this passage is that ________.
A) college education should be improved through radical measures
B) more freedom of choice should be given to students in their studies
C) traditional college lectures should be replaced by dramatized performances
D) interaction should be encouraged in the process of teaching
29.	By saying “They seemed ‘a priesthood, rather uneven in their merits but uniform in their bearing...’” (Lines 3-4, Para. 4), the author means that ________.
A) professors are a group of professionals that differ in their academic ability but behave in the same way
B) professors are like priests wearing the same kind of black gown but having different roles to play
C) there is no fundamental difference between professors and priests though they differ in their merits
D) professors at the University of Pennsylvania used to wear black suits which made them look like priests
30.	Whose teaching method is particularly commended by the author?
A) Ezekiel Cheever’s.
B) Cotton Mather’s.
C) Alfred North Whitehead’s.
D) Patricia Nelson Limerick’s.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Take the case of public education alone. The principal difficulty faced by the schools has been the tremendous increase in the number of pupils. This has been caused by the advance of the legal age for going into industry and the impossibility of finding a job even when the legal age has been reached. In view of the technological improvements in the last few years, business will require in the future proportionately fewer workers than ever before. The result will be still further raising of he legal age for going into employment, and still further difficulty in finding employment when hat age has been attained. If we cannot put our children to work, we must put them in school.
We may also be quite confident that the present trend toward a shorter day and a shorter week will be maintained. We have developed and shall continue to have a new leisure class. Already the public agencies for adult education are swamped by the tide that has swept over them since depression began. They will be little better off when it is over. Their support must come from the taxpayer.
It is surely too much to hope that these increases in the cost of public education can be borne by the local communities. They cannot care for the present restricted and inadequate system. The local communities have failed in their efforts to cope with unemployment. They cannot expect to cope with public education on the scale on which we must attempt it. The answer to the problem of unemployment has been Federal relief. The answer to the problem of public education may have to be much the same, and properly so. If there is one thing in which the citizens of all parts of the country have an interest, it is in the decent education of the citizens of all parts of the country. Our income tax now goes in part to keep our neighbors alive. It may have to go in part as well to make our neighbors intelligent. We are now attempting to preserve the present generation through Federal relief of the destitute (贫民). Only a people determined to ruin the next generation will refuse such Federal funds as public education may require.
31.	What is the passage mainly about?
A) How to persuade local communities to provide more funds.
B) How to cope with the shortage of funds for public education.
C) How to solve the rising unemployment problem.
D) How to improve the public education system.
32.	What is the reason for the increase in the number of students?
A) The requirement of educated workers by business.
B) Raising of the legal age for going to work.
C) The trend toward a shorter workday.
D) People’s concern for the future of the next generation.
33.	The public agencies for adult education will be little better off because ________.
A) the unemployed are too poor to continue their education
B) a new leisure class has developed
C) they are still suffering from the depression
D) an increase in taxes could be a problem
34.	According to the author, the answer to the problem of public education is that the Federal government ________.
A) should allocate Federal funds for public education
B) should demand that local communities provide support
C) should raise taxes to meet the needs of public education
D) should first of all solve the problem of unemployment
35.	Why does the author say “Only a people determined to ruin the next generation will refuse such Federal funds as public education may require” (Lines 10-11, Para. 3)?
A) Only by appropriating adequate Federal funds for education can the next generation have a bright future.
B) Citizens of all parts of the country agree that the best way to support education is to use Federal funds.
C) People all over the country should make contributions to education in the interest of the next generation.
D) Educated people are determined to use part of the Federal funds to help the poor.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
A new high-performance contact lens under development at the department for applied physics at the University of Heidelberg will not only correct ordinary vision defects but will enhance normal night vision as much as five times, making people’s vision sharper than that of cats.
Bille and his team work with an optical instrument called an active mirror—a device used in astronomical telescopes to spot newly emerging stars and far distant galaxies. Connected to a wave-front sensor that tracks and measures the course of a laser beam into the eye and back, the aluminum mirror detects the deficiencies of the cornea, the transparent protective layer covering the lens of the human eye. The highly precise data from the two instruments—which, Bille hopes, will one day be found at the opticians (眼镜商) all over the world—serve as a basis for the production of completely individualized contact lenses that correct and enhance the wearer’s vision.
By day, Bille’s contact lenses will focus rays of light so accurately on the retina （视网膜）that the image of a small leaf or the outline of a far distant tree will be formed with a sharpness that surpasses that of conventional vision aids by almost half a diopter ( 屈光度). At night, the lenses have an even greater potential. “Because the new lens—in contrast to the already existing ones—also works when it’s dark and the pupil is wide open,” says Bille, “lens wearers will be able to identify a face at a distance of 100 meters”—80 meters farther than they would normally be able to see. In his experiments night vision was enhanced by an even greater factor: in semi-darkness, test subjects could see up to 15 times better than without the lenses.
Bille’s lenses are expected to reach the market in the year 2000, and one tentative plan is to use the Internet to transmit information on patients’ visual defects from the optician to the manufacturer, who will then produce and mail the contact lenses within a couple of days. The physicist expects the lenses to cost about a dollar a pair, about the same as conventional one-day disposable lenses.
36.	The new contact lens is meant for ________.
A) astronomical observations
B) the night blind
C) those with vision defects
D) optical experiments
37.	What do the two instruments mentioned in the second paragraph (Line 5) refer to?
A) The astronomical telescope and the wave-front sensor.
B) The aluminum mirror and the laser beam.
C) The active mirror and the contact lens.
D) The aluminum mirror and the wave-front sensor.
38.	Individualized contact lenses (Line 7, Para. 2) are lenses designed ________.
A) to work like an astronomical telescope
B) to suit the wearer’s specific needs
C) to process extremely accurate data
D) to test the wearer’s eyesight
39.	According to Bille, with the new lenses the wearer’s vision ________.
A) will be far better at night than in the daytime
B) may be broadened about 15 times than without them
C) can be better improved in the daytime than at night
D) will be sharper by a much greater degree at night than in the daytime
40.	Which of the following is true about Bille’s lenses?
A) Their production process is complicated.
B) They will be sold at a very low price.
C) They have to be replaced every day.
D) Purchase orders can be made through the Internet.

Part IV Error Correction (15 minutes)
Directions:	This part consists of a short passage. In this passage, there are altogether 10 mistakes, one in each numbered line. You may have to change a word, add a word or delete a word. Mark out the mistakes and put the corrections in the blanks provided. If you change a word, cross it out and write the correct word in the corresponding blank.

The Seattle Times Company is one newspaper firm that has recognized the need for change and done something about it. In the newspaper industry, papers must reflect the diversity of the communities to which they provide information.
It must reflect that diversity with their news coverage or risk (S1) losing their readers’ interest and their advertisers’ support.
Operating within Seattle, which has 20 percents racial (S2) minorities, the paper has put into place policies and procedures for hiring and maintain a diverse workforce. The (S3) underlying reason for the change is that for information to be fair, appropriate, and subjective, it should be reported by the (S4) same kind of population that reads it.
A diversity committee composed of reporters, editors, and photographers meets regularly to value the Seattle Times’ (S5) content and to educate the rest of the newsroom staff about diversity issues. In an addition, the paper instituted a content (S6) audit (审查) that evaluates the frequency and manner of representation of woman and people of color in photographs. (S7)
Early audits showed that minorities were pictured far too infrequently and were pictured with a disproportion ate number of negative articles. The audit results from (S8) improvement in the frequency of majority representation and (S9) their portrayal in neutral or positive situations. And, with a (S10) result, the Seattle Times has improved as a newspaper.
The diversity training and content audits helped the Seattle Times Company to win the Personnel Journal Optimal Award for excellence in managing change.

Passage One
A few months ago, millions of people in London heard alarms all over the town. The Emergency services, the Fire Departments, the Police, hospitals, and ambulances stood by, ready to go into action. In railway underground stations, people read notices and maps which told them where to go and what to do in the emergency. This was Exercise Flood Call, to prepare people for a flood emergency. London wasn’t flooded yet, but it is possible that it would be. In 1236 and in 1663, London was badly flooded. In 1928, people living in Westminster, the heart of London, drowned in floods. And in 1953, one hundred people, living on the eastern edge of the London suburbs were killed, again, in the floods. At last, Greater London Council took actions to prevent this disaster from happening again. Though a flood wall was built in the 1960s, Londoners still must be prepared for the possible disaster. If it happens, 50 underground stations will be under water. Electricity, gas and phone services will be out of action. Roads will be drowned. It will be impossible to cross any of the bridges between north and south London. Imagine: London will look like the famous Italian city, Venice. But this Exercise Flood Call didn’t cause panic among Londoners. Most people knew it was just a warning. One lady said, “It’s a flood warning, isn’t it? The water doesn’t look high to me.”
Question 11: What happened in London a few months ago?
Question 12: What measure was taken against floods in London in the 1960s?
Question 13: What can we learnt from the lady’s comment?
Passage Two
America’s national symbol, the bald eagle, almost went extinct twenty years ago, but it has made a comeback. In fact, the U.S. Fish and Wild Life Service is considering the possibility of taking it off the Endangered Species List. Once, more than fifty hundred pairs of bald eagles nested across the country, but by 1960 that number had fallen below four hundred. The chief killer was the widely used DDT. Fish, soaked up DDT, died, and were washed up on shores, where bald eagles feasted on them. DDT prevented eagle egg shells from thickening. The shells became so thin that they shattered before the babies hatched. Fortunately, in 1972, a law was passed to ban DDT, which saved the bald eagle from total wipeout. And since then wild life biologists had reintroduced bald eagles from Canada to America. The result was that last year U.S. bird watchers counted eleven thousand six hundred and ten bald eagles in the country. If it were dropped from the Endangered Species List, the bald eagle would still be a threatened species. That means the bird would continue to get the same protection. No hunting allowed, and no disturbing of nests. But bald eagles still face tough times. The destruction of their natural homes could be the next DDT causing eagle numbers to drop quickly.
Question 14: What was the main harmful effect of the pests killer DDT on bald eagles?
Question 15: What measure did the wild life biologist take to increase the number of bald eagles?
Question 16: According to the speaker, what is the possible danger facing bald eagles?
Passage Three
If the earth gets hotter in the new century, what will happen to animals and the plants which animals depend on for survival? The question offers another way of looking at the “Greenhouse Effect”. People have talked about the general problem of “Global Warming” for some time. But they were usually worried about things like whether to buy a home on the coast. Biologists and other scientists turn their attention to plants and animals at an important meeting that took place last October. They were reviewed evidence that plants and animals are sensitive to climate. Since the Ice Age ended ten thousand years ago and warmer temperatures returned to the northern latitudes, many species have migrated north. If the predictions about the Greenhouse are correct, temperatures will rise by the same amount in the next one hundred years as they did in the past ten thousand. Will animals and plants be able to adapt that quickly to change in the environment? Many won’t. Certain species will probably become very rare. Experts say plants under climate stress will be very open to disease and fire. Forest fires may become more common. That, in turn, man harm animals that depend on the trees for food will for shelter. Any preserves we set up to protect endangered species may become useless as the species are forced to migrate along with their natural homes. Change is a part of life, but rapid change, says scientist George Woodwell, is the enemy of life.
Question 17: What is the concern of ordinary people about the “Greenhouse Effect”?
Question 18: What has happened since the end of the ICE AGE?
Question 19: What will be a possible threat to plants in the future?
Question 20: According to the passage, what will probably happen to the endangered species?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are four passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
In 1985 when a Japan Air Lines (JAL) jet crashed, its president, Yasumoto Takagi, called each victim’s family to apologize, and then promptly resigned. And in 1987, when a subsidiary of Toshiba sole sensitive military technology to the former Soviet Union, the chairman of Toshiba gave up his post.
These executive actions, which Toshiba calls “the highest form of apology,” may seem bizarre to US managers. No one at Boeing resigned after the JAL crash, which may have been caused by a faulty Boeing repair.
The difference between the two business cultures centers around different definitions of delegation.
While US executives give both responsibility and authority to their employees, Japanese executives delegate only authority—the responsibility is still theirs. Although the subsidiary that sold the sensitive technology to the Soviets had its own management, the Toshiba top executives said they “must take personal responsibility for not creating an atmosphere throughout the Toshiba group that would make such activity unthinkable, even in an independently run subsidiary.”
Such acceptance of community responsibility is not unique to businesses in Japan. School principals in Japan have resigned when their students committed major crimes after school hours.
Even if they do not quit, Japanese executives will often accept primary responsibility in other ways, such as taking the first pay cut when a company gets into financial trouble. Such personal sacrifices, even if they are largely symbolic, help to create the sense of community and employee loyalty that is crucial to the Japanese way of doing business.
Harvard Business School professor George Lodge calls the ritual acceptance of blame “almost a feudal (封建的) way of purging (清除) the community of dishonor,” and to some in the United States, such resignations look cowardly. However, in an era in which both business and governmental leaders seem particularly good at evading responsibility, many US managers would probably welcome an infusion (灌输) of the Japanese sense of responsibility. If, for instance, US automobile company executives offered to reduce their own salaries before they asked their workers to take pay cuts, negotiations would probably take on a very different character.
21.	Why did the chairman of Toshiba resign his position in 1987?
A) Because in Japan, the leakage of a state secret to Russians is a grave crime.
B) Because he had been under attack for shifting responsibility to his subordinates.
C) Because in Japan, the chief executive of a corporation is held responsible for the mistake made by its subsidiaries.
D) Because he had been accused of being cowardly towards crises that were taking place in his corporation.
22.	According to the passage if you want to be a good manager in Japan, you have to ________.
A) apologize promptly for your subordinates’ mistakes
B) be skillful in accepting blames from customers
C) make symbolic sacrifices whenever necessary
D) create a strong sense of company loyalty
23.	What’s Professor George Lodge’s attitude towards the resignations of Japanese corporate leaders?
A) Sympathetic.
B) Biased.
C) Critical.
D) Approving.
24.	Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A) Boeing had nothing to do with the JAL air crash in 1985.
B) American executives consider authority and responsibility inseparable.
C) School principals bear legal responsibility for students’ crimes.
D) Persuading employees to take pay cuts doesn’t help solve corporate crises.
25.	The passage is mainly about ________.
A) resignation as an effective way of dealing with business crises
B) the importance of delegating responsibility to employees
C) ways of evading responsibility in times of crises
D) the difference between two business cultures
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
As machines go, the car is not terribly noisy, nor terribly polluting, nor terribly dangerous; and on all those dimensions it has become better as the century has grown older. The main problem is its prevalence, and the social costs that ensue from the use by everyone of something that would be fairly harmless if, say, only the rich were to use it. It is a price we pay for equality.
Before becoming too gloomy, it is worth recalling why the car has been arguably the most successful and popular product of the whole of the past 100 years—and remains so. The story begins with the environmental improvement it brought in the 1900s. In New York city in 1900, according to the Car Culture, a 1975 book by J. Flink, a historian, horses deposited 2.5 million pounds of manure (粪) and 60,000 gallons of urine (尿) every day. Every year, the city authorities had to remove an average of 15,000 dead horses from the streets, it made cars smell of roses.
Cars were also wonderfully flexible. The main earlier solution to horse pollution and traffic jams was the electric trolley bus (电车). But that required fixed overhead wires, and rails and platforms, which were expensive, ugly, and inflexible. The car could go from any A to any B, and allowed towns to develop in all directions with low-density housing, rather than just being concentrated along the trolley or rail lines. Rural areas benefited too, for they became less remote.
However, since pollution became a concern in the 1950s, experts have predicted—wrongly—that the car boom was about to end. In his book Mr. Flink argued that by 1973 the American market had become saturated, at one car for every 2.25 people, and so had the markets of Japan and Western Europe (because of land shortages). Environmental worries and diminishing oil reserves would prohibit mass car use anywhere else.
He was wrong. Between 1970 and 1990, whereas America’s population grew by 23%, the number of cars on its roads grew by 60%. There is now one car for every 1.7 people there, one for every 2.1 in Japan, one for every 5.3 in Britain. Around 550 million cars are already on the roads, not to mention all the trucks and mocorcyeles, and about 50 million new ones are made each year worldwide. Will it go on? Undoubtedly, because people want it to.
26.	As is given in the first paragraph, the reason why the car has become a problem is that ________.
A) poor people can’t afford it
B) it is too expensive to maintain
C) too many people are using it
D) it causes too many road accidents
27.	According to the passage, the car started to gain popularity because ________.
A) it didn’t break down as easily as a horse
B) it had a comparatively pleasant odor
C) it caused less pollution than horses
D) it brightened up the gloomy streets
28.	What impact did the use of cars have on society?
A) People were compelled to leave downtown areas.
B) People were able to live in less crowded suburban areas.
C) Business along trolley and rail lines slackened.
D) City streets were free of ugly overhead wires.
29.	Mr. Flink argued in his book that cars would not be widely used in other countries because ________.
A) the once booming car market has become saturated
B) traffic jams in those countries are getting more and more serious
C) expensive motorways are not available in less developed countries
D) people worry about pollution and the diminishing oil resources
30.	What’s wrong with Mr. Flink’s prediction?
A) The use of automobiles has kept increasing worldwide.
B) New generations of cars are virtually pollution free.
C) The population of America has not increased as fast.
D) People’s environmental concerns are constantly increasing.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Crying is hardly an activity encouraged by society. Tears, be they of sorrow, anger, or joy, typically make Americans feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. The shedder of tears is likely to apologize, even when a devastating (毁灭性的) tragedy was the provocation. The observer of tears is likely to do everything possible to put an end to the emotional outpouring. But judging from recent studies of crying behavior, links between illness and crying and the chemical composition of tears, both those responses to tears are often inappropriate and may even be counterproductive.
Humans are the only animals definitely known to shed emotional tears. Since evolution has given rise to few, if any, purposeless physiological responses, it is logical to assume that crying has one or more functions that enhance survival.
Although some observers have suggested that crying is a way to elicit assistance from others (as a crying baby might from its mother), the shedding of tears is hardly necessary to get help. Vocal cries would have been quite enough, more likely than tears to gain attention. So, it appears, there must be something special about tears themselves.
Indeed, the new studies suggest that emotional tears may play a direct role in alleviating stress. University of Minnesota researchers who are studying the chemical composition of tears have recently isolated two important chemicals from emotional tears. Both chemicals are found only in tears that are shed in response to emotion. Tears shed because of exposure to cut onion would contain no such substance.
Researchers at several other institutions are investigating the usefulness of tears as a means of diagnosing human ills and monitoring drugs.
At Tulane University’s Teat Analysis Laboratory Dr. Peter Kastl and his colleagues report that they can use tears to detect drug abuse and exposure to medication (药物), to determine whether a contact lens fits properly of why it may be uncomfortable, to study the causes of “dry eye” syndrome and the effects of eye surgery, and perhaps even to measure exposure to environmental pollutants.
At Columbia University Dr. Liasy Faris and colleagues are studying tears for clues to the diagnosis of diseases away from the eyes. Tears can be obtained painlessly without invading the body and only tiny amounts are needed to perform highly refined analyses.
31.	It is known from the first paragraph that ________.
A) shedding tears gives unpleasant feelings to American
B) crying may often imitate people or even result in tragedy
C) crying usually wins sympathy from other people
D) one who sheds tears in public will be blamed
32.	What does “both those responses to tears” (Line 5, Para, 1) refer to?
A) Crying out of sorrow and shedding tears for happiness.
B) The embarrassment and unpleasant sensation of the observers.
C) The tear shedder’s apology and the observer’s effort to stop the crying.
D) Linking illness with crying and finding the chemical composition of tears.
33.	“Counterproductive” (Lines 5, Para, 1) very probably means “________”.
A) having no effect at all
B) leading to tension
C) producing disastrous impact
D) harmful to health
34.	What does the author say about crying?
A) It is a pointless physiological response to the environment.
B) It must have a role to play in man’s survival.
C) It is meant to get attention and assistance.
D) It usually produces the desired effect.
35.	What can be inferred from the new studies of tears?
A) Emotional tears have the function of reducing stress.
B) Exposure to excessive medication may increase emotional tears.
C) Emotional tears can give rise to “dry eye” syndrome in some cases.
D) Environmental pollutants can induce the shedding of emotional tears.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
It is no secret among athletes that in order to improve performance you’ve got to work hard.
However, hard training breaks you down and makes you weaker, it is rest that makes you stronger.
Improvement only occurs during the rest period following hard training. This adaptation is accomplished by improving efficiency of the heart and certain systems within the muscle cells.
During recovery periods these systems build to greater levels to compensate for the stress that you have applied. The result is that you are now at a higher level of performance.
If sufficient rest is not included in a training program, imbalance between excess training and inadequate rest will occur, and performance will decline. The “overtraining syndrome (综合症)” is the name given to the collection of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms due to overtraining that has persisted for weeks to months. It is marked by cumulative exhaustion that persists even after recovery periods.
The most common symptom is fatigue. This may limit workouts and may be present at rest. The athletes may also become moody, easily imitated, have altered sleep patterns, become depressed, or lose the competitive desire and enthusiasm for the sport. Some will report decreased appetite and weight loss. Physical symptoms include persistent muscular soreness, increased frequency of viral (病毒性的) illnesses, and increased incidence of injuries.
The treatment for the overtraining syndrome is rest. The longer the overtraining has occurred, the more rest required, therefore, early detection is very important. If the overtraining has only occurred for a short period of time (e.g. 3-4 weeks) then interrupting training for 3-5 days is usually sufficient rest. It is important that the factors that lead to overtraining be identified and corrected. Otherwise, the overtraining syndrome is likely to recur. The overtraining syndrome should be considered in any athlete who manifests symptoms of prolonged fatigue and whose performance has leveled off or decreased. It is important to exclude any underlying illness that may be responsible for the fatigue.
36.	The first paragraph of the passage tells us that ________.
A) the harder an athlete trains, the better his performance will be

Part V Writing
It can be discerned that the American students prefer to read the popular novels rather than any other kind of books, such as the unpopular fictions, technical books, poems and so on. The percentage of the popular novel is about 68.2% currently. Comparatively, other kind of novels is about 16.8%, 8.3%, and 5.2%.
It is not difficult to understand why the popular novels can attract so many students. The popular novel is interesting, and not so abstract as books that are full of the mathematic formulas. However, as university students, study is the primary task for us to do. So it’s advisable that we should pay more attention to the books in our major. Fictions may make our life rich and colorful, but it cannot become the major part of our life.
As far as I am concerned, I would like to spend my spare time on reading academic collection of dissertations, periodicals in my major, such as technology digests, computer newspapers and so forth, because I want to do a good job in my subjects. Fortunately, my dreams come true. Meanwhile, I have gained other things, i.e. I’ve laid a solid foundation in specialized field, which makes me feel easy to contrive the electronic circuits that have to be done during our bachelor years. Thanks to those books!

Section B
Passage One
Graffiti is drawing or writing often found in a wall in public places. These drawings and writings are usually rude, humorous, or political. The words Graffiti” comes from an Italian word meaning address. Graffiti provides a record of the past because people have written on walls for centuries. Cave drawings are the earliest examples we have of the art of graffiti.
Writing on walls is a way to comment on the world we live in. Women’s liberation groups in Britain, for example, have used graffiti to show their anger at the sex discrimination of many advertisements where women’s bodies are used to sell goods.
Yesterday’s graffiti can be today’s foreign attraction. When the Berlin wall ca me down in 1989, people found that it was covered with graffiti from all over the world. Graves of famous people, like rock-star Jim Morrison, are covered with written messages from fans.
Graffiti is also a popular art form. Graffiti pictures have gained respect in artistic circles. Today, graffiti is likely to be found hanging inside modern, New York apartments as well as in the downtown streets. In New York, graffiti pictures have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Graffiti artists have been paid to use their art to brighten up dull environments.
But graffiti can bring us trouble. Scenes of natural beauty and important landmarks have been spoiled by mindless graffiti. The London underground authority has spent about 2 million pounds a year on removing graffiti for trains and stations. If you are caught doing it, you can be sent to person. In Britain, the maxim um sentence for this type of crime is ten years.
Whether you think graffiti is mindless violence against property, or a living art form, its popularity suggests that it is here to stay.
11.	What do women’s liberation groups in Britain do with graffiti?
12.	What do some New Yorkers think of graffiti?
13.	Why does the speaker cite the example of graffiti in the London underground?
Passage Two
The Asian elephant is one of the world’s rarest animal. Unfortunately, its sad condition has not been as well publicized as that of the African elephant. This is because Asian elephant’s ivory supplies only a small percentage of the world ivory trade. In fact, we know very little about the Asian elephant. They live in the remote forests of southern Asia and it is therefore very difficult to study them. Most knowledge of Asian elephants is from those that have been captured, or tamed. Asian elephants are easier to tame than African elephants. The elephants you see in the circuses and zoos are nearly always Asian.
The major reason for the decline of Asian elephants is the harm to their forests. The huge increase in the human population has caused the destruction of the Asian forest for human population. As a result, the Asian elephants are compelled to scatter in different areas. Originally they lived all over the continent, but now there are only small isolated populations left. These isolated elephant populations are vulnerable to extinction.
While Asian elephants are threatened by illegal capture and detaining, they are also killed for ivory and skin. In July 1990, a British wildlife group uncovered a black market for elephant skin. Elephants are shot in the forest along the border between Thailand and Burma, and their skin was sold to factories in Bangkok. T heir skin is made into shoes, belts, suitcases, wallets, etc, to sell to tourists.
14.	What’s the difference between the Asian elephant and the African elephant?
15.	Where does most knowledge of Asian elephants come from?
16.	What’s the major cause in the decline of Asian elephants?
Passage Three
After the early period of settlements, the first sharp increase in immigration took place in the 1830’s and 1840’s. This brought to America flocks of people from northern Europe who lost employment in the Industrial Revolution, and then a great number of Irish people who fled from famine. German political refugees arrived shortly after. Many immigrants from northern and western Europe settled on farms in the Middle-west. The Irish became construction laborers on roads, bridges, and railroads.
In the 1880’s, a tremendous flood of immigrants began coming in, this time largely from southern and eastern Europe. To most Americans, these newcomers seemed far more strange than the early settlers. Their languages, customs, and ways of life were very different from those of Americans. The newcomers moved into the poorest neighborhood of the large cities. They tended to stay together and cling to their old ways. As they were accustomed to poverty, they were willing to work for very low wages. This made other workers, especially those in labor unions, afraid that the immigrants with the lower wage level would take jobs away from them. Indeed, organized labor became one of the key opponents of continued immigration.
This opposition finally lead to the posting of immigration law in the 1920’s, which restricted further immigration. In 1965, these unfair laws were replaced by a new immigration act, which granted equal opportunities to foreigners, regardless of their place of origin. Asians, like Koreans and Vietnamese, soon began to arrive. Many of these newcomers have worked very hard to establish themselves in their new land.
17.	Why did northern European people come to settle down in the United States?
18.	What did the labor unions worry about?
19.	What was the purpose of the immigration law passed in the 1920’s?
20.	What do we know from the passage about Asian immigrants?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are four passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
For years, doctors advised their patients that the only thing taking multivitamins does is give them extensive urine (尿). After all, true vitamin deficiencies are practically unheard of in industrialized countries. Now it seems those doctors may have been wrong. The results of a growing number of studies suggest that even a modest vitamin shortfall can be harmful to your health. Although proof of the benefits of multivitamins is still far from certain, the few dollars you spend on them is probably a good investment.
Or at least that’s the argument put forward in the New England Journal of Medicine. Ideally, say Dr. Walter Willett and Dr. Meir Stampfer of Harvard, all vitamin supplements would be evaluated in scientifically rigorous clinical trials.
But those studies can take a long time and often raise more questions than they answer. At some point, while researchers work on figuring out where the truth lies, it just makes sense to say the potential benefit outweighs the cost.
The best evidence to date concerns folate, one of the B vitamins. It’s been proved to limit the number of defects in embryos (胚胎), and a recent trial found that folate in combination with vitamin B 12 and a form of B6 also decreases the re-blockage of arteries after surgical repair.
The news on vitamin E has been more mixed. Healthy folks who take 400 international units daily for at least two years appear somewhat less likely to develop heart disease. But when doctors give vitamin E to patients who already have he art disease, the vitamin doesn’t seem to help. It may turn out that vitamin E plays a role in prevention but cannot undo serious damage.
Despite vitamin C’s great popularity, consuming large amounts of it still has not been positively linked to any great benefit. The body quickly becomes saturated with C and simply excretes (排泄) any excess.
The multivitamins question boils down to this: Do you need to wait until all the evidence is in before you take them, or are you willing to accept that there’s enough evidence that they don’t hurt and could help?
If the latter, there’s no need to go to extremes and buy the biggest horse pills or the most expensive bottles. Large doses can cause trouble, including excessive bleeding and nervous system problems.
Multivitamins are no substitute for exercise and a balanced diet, of course.
As long as you understand that any potential benefit is modest and subject to further refinement, taking a daily multivitamin makes a lot of sense.
21.	At one time doctors discouraged taking multivitamins because they believed that multivitamins ________.
A) could not easily be absorbed by the human body
B) were potentially harmful to people’s health
C) were too expensive for daily consumption
D) could not provide any cure for vitamin deficiencies
22.	According to the author, clinical trials of vitamin supplements ________.
A) often result in misleading conclusions
B) take time and will not produce conclusive results
C) should be conducted by scientists on a larger scale
D) appear to be a sheer waste of time and resources
23.	It has been found that vitamin E ________.
A) should be taken by patients regularly and persistently
B) can effectively reduce the recurrence of heart disease
C) has a preventive but not curative effect on heart disease
D) should be given to patients with heart disease as early as possible
24.	It can be seen that large doses of multivitamins ________.
A) may bring about serious side effects
B) may help prevent excessive bleeding
C) are likely to induce the blockage of arteries
D) are advisable for those with vitamin deficiencies
25.	The author concludes the passage with the advice that ________.
A) the benefit of daily multivitamin intake outweighs that of exercise and a balanced diet
B) it’s risky to take multivitamins without knowing their specific function
C) the potential benefit of multivitamins can never be overestimated
D) it’s reasonable to take a rational dose of multivitamins daily
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge (剧增) of women in the workforce may portend a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse (反面) of this concern is that the prospects of becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriages. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to postpone marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy rebounds, the number of marriages also rises.
Coincident with the increase in women working outside the home is the increase in divorce rates. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife’s work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible. Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. Given high unemployment, inflationary problems, and slow growth in real earnings, a working wife can increase household income and relieve some of these pressing financial burdens. By raising a family’s standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family’s financial and emotional stability.
Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce.
On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union.
Also, a major part of women’s inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. With higher earning capacity and status occupations outside of the home comes the capacity to exercise power within the family. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities.
26.	The word “portend” (Line 2, Para. 1) is closest in meaning to “________”.
A) defy
B) signal
C) suffer from
D) result from
27.	It is said in the passage that when the economy slides, ________.
A) men would choose working women as their marriage partners
B) more women would get married to seek financial security
C) even working women would worry about their marriages
D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being
28.	If women find fulfillment through work outside the home, ________.
A) they are more likely to dominate their marriage partners
B) their husbands are expected to do more housework
C) their marriage ties can be strengthened
D) they tend to put their career before marriage
29.	One reason why women with no career may seek a divorce is that ________.
A) they feel that they have been robbed of their freedom
B) they are afraid of being bossed around by their husbands
C) they feel that their partners fail to live up to their expectations
D) they tend to suspect their husbands’ loyalty to their marriage
30.	Which of the following statements can best summarize the author’s view in the passage?
A) The stability of marriage and the divorce rate may reflect the economic situation of the country.
B) Even when economically independent, most women have to struggle for real equality in marriage.
C) In order to secure their marriage women should work outside the home and remain independent.
D) The impact of the growing female workforce on marriage varies from case to case.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
For most thinkers since the Greek philosophers, it was self-evident that the re is something called human nature, something that constitutes the essence of man. There were various views about what constitutes it, but there was agreement that such an essence exists—that is to say, that there is something by virtue of which man is man. Thus man was defined as a rational being, as a social animal, an animal that can make tools, or a symbol-making animal.
More recently, this traditional view has begun to be questioned. One reason for this change was the increasing emphasis given to the historical approach to man. An examination of the history of humanity suggested that man in our epoch is so different from man in previous times that it seemed unrealistic to assume that men in every age have had in common something that can be called “human nature.” The historical approach was reinforced, particularly in the United States, by studies in the field of cultural anthropology (人类学). The study of primitive peoples has discovered such a diversity of customs, values, feelings, and thoughts that many anthropologists arrived at the concept that man is born as a blank sheet of paper on which each culture writes its text. Another factor contributing to the tendency to deny the assumption of a fixed human nature was that the concept has so often been abused as a shield behind which the most inhuman acts are committed. In the name of human nature, for example, Aristotle and most thinkers up to the eighteenth century defended slavery. Or in order to prove the rationality and necessity of the capitalist form of society, scholars have tried to make a case for acquisitiveness, competitiveness, and selfishness as innate (天生的) human traits. Popularly, one refers cynically to “human nature” in accepting the inevitability of such undesirable human behavior as greed, murder, cheating and lying.
Another reason for skepticism about the concept of human nature probably lies in the influence of evolutionary thinking. Once man came to be seen as developing in the process of evolution, the idea of a substance which is contained in his essence seemed untenable. Yet I believe it is precisely from an evolutionary standpoint that we can expect new insight into the problem of the nature of man.
31.	The traditional view of “human nature” was strongly challenged by ________.
A) the emergence of the evolutionary theory
B) the historical approach to man
C) new insight into human behavior
D) the philosophical analysis of slavery
32.	According to the passage, anthropologists believe that human beings ________.
A) have some traits in common
B) are born with diverse cultures
C) are born without a fixed nature
D) change their characters as they grow up
33.	The author mentioned Aristotle, a great ancient thinker, in order to ________.
A) emphasize that he contributed a lot to defining the concept of “human nature”
B) show that the concept of “human nature” was used to justify social evils
C) prove that he had a profound influence on the concept of “human nature”
D) support the idea that some human traits are acquired
34.	The word “untenable” (Line 3) in the last paragraph of the passage most probably means ________.
A) invaluable
B) imaginable
C) changeable
D) indefensible
35.	Most philosophers believed that human nature ________.
A) is the quality distinguishing man from other animals
B) consists of competitiveness and selfishness
C) is something partly innate and partly acquired
D) consists of rationality and undesirable behavior
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Richard Satava, program manager for advanced medical technologies, has been a driving force in bringing virtual reality to medicine, where computers create a “virtual” or simulated environment for surgeons and other medical practitioners (从业者).
“With virtual reality we’ll be able to put a surgeon in every trench,” said Satava. He envisaged a time when soldiers who are wounded fighting overseas are put in mobile surgical units equipped with computers.
The computers would transmit images of the soldiers to surgeons back in the U.S. The surgeons would look at the soldier through virtual reality helmets (头盔) that contain a small screen displaying the image of the wound. The doctors would guide robotic instruments in the battlefield mobile surgical unit that operate on the soldier.
Although Satava’s vision may be years away from standard operating procedure, scientists are progressing toward virtual reality surgery. Engineers at an international organization in California are developing a tele-operating device. As surgeons watch a three-dimensional image of the surgery, they move instruments that are connected to a computer, which passes their movements to robotic instruments that perform the surgery. The computer provides feedback to the surgeon on force, textures, and sound.
These technological wonders may not yet be part of the community hospital setting but increasingly some of the machinery is finding its way into civilian medicine. At Wayne State University Medical School, surgeon Lucia Zamorano takes images of the brain from computerized scans and uses a computer program to produce a 3-D image. She can then maneuver the 3-D image on the computer screen to map the shortest, least invasive surgical path to the tumor (肿瘤). Zamorano is also using technology that attaches a probe to surgical instruments so that she can track their positions. While cutting away a tumor deep in the brain, she watches the movement of her surgical tools in a computer graphics image of the patient’s brain taken before surgery.
During these procedures—operations that are done through small cuts in the body in which a miniature camera and surgical tools are maneuvered—surgeons are wearing 3-D glasses for a better view. And they are commanding robot surgeons to cut away tissue more accurately than human surgeons can.
Satava says, “We are in the midst of a fundamental change in the field of medicine.”
36.	According to Richard Satava, the application of virtual reality to medicine ________.
A) will enable surgeons to be physically present on every battlefield
B) can raise the spirits of soldiers wounded on the battlefield
C) will greatly improve medical conditions on the battlefield
D) can shorten the time for operations on soldiers wounded on the battlefield
37.	Richard Satava has visions of ________.
A) using a remote-control technique to treat wounded soldiers fighting overseas
B) wounded soldiers being saved by doctors wearing virtual reality helmets on the battlefield
C) wounded soldiers being operated on by specially trained surgeons
D) setting up mobile surgical units overseas
38.	How is virtual reality surgery performed?
A) It is performed by a computer-designed high precision device.
B) Surgeons wear virtual reality helmets to receive feedback provided by a computer.
C) Surgeons move robotic instruments by means of a computer linked to them.
D) A 3-D image records the movements of the surgeons during the operation.
39.	During virtual reality operations, the surgeon can have a better view of the cuts in the body because ________.
A) he is looking at the cuts on a computer screen
B) the cuts can be examined from different angles

Thomas Malthus published his “Essay on the Principle of Population” almost 200 years ago. Ever since then, forecasters have being warning that worldwide famine was (S1) just around the next corner. The fast-growing population’s demand for food, they warned, would soon exceed their (S2) supply, leading to widespread food shortages and starvation.
But in reality, the world’s total grain harvest has risen steadily over the years. Except for relative isolated trouble (S3) spots like present-day Somalia, and occasional years of good harvests, the world’s food crisis has remained just (S4) around the corner. Most experts believe this can continue even as if the population doubles by the mid-21st century, (S5) although feeding 10 billion people will not be easy for politics, economic and environmental reasons. Optimists (S6) point to concrete examples of continued improvements in yield. In Africa, by instance, improved seed, more (S7) fertilizer and advanced growing practices have more than double corn and wheat yields in an experiment. Elsewhere, (S8) rice experts in the Philippines are producing a plant with few (S9) stems and more seeds. There is no guarantee that plant breeders can continue to develop new, higher-yielding crop, but most researchers see their success to date as reason (S10) for hope.

【短文大意】 本文介绍了维生素的作用。越来越多研究表明即使少量的维生素缺乏也会有损身体健康。尽管关于维生素好处的证据还不是很充分，但花钱买维生素是很划算的。健康人至少连续两年每天吃400单位维生素E就不大可能患心脏病。但心脏病患者再吃维生素E却于事无补。维生素E的作用主要是预防而不是治疗疾病。但过量服用维生素也会引起麻烦。
21.	A。本题为事实推断题。依据首段第一句话就可推断出以前的医生对服用复合维生素不以为然，因为他们认为维生素不能被人体吸收—从小便中排出体外。所以A为正确选项。
22.	B。细节推断题。其答题依据为第二段第二句话。有关维生素的实验研究往往费时而且引起更多的疑问，言外之意此实验研究的结果没有定论。故B为正确答案。
23.	C。事实判断题。其答题依据为第四段，尤其是该段最后一句。维生素E有预防心脏病的功效但不能治好心脏病。故C 正确。B为干扰项，服用维生素E只是不太可能患心脏病，并不是有效减少心脏病的复发率，所以B不对。
24.	A。细节判断题。答题依据为第七段第二句话。大剂量服用维生素会引起大出血、神经系统的毛病及其它副作用。故A为正确答案。
25.	D。作者观点推断题。答题依据为最后一段。维生素不能代替运动和均衡的饮食。只要人们对维生素的好处不盲从，那每天适量服用它就很有益处。故D 为正确答案。
Passage Two
【短文大意】本文介绍了关于职业女性与婚姻的两种观点。有些未来学家认为随着女性劳动力人数的急剧增长，许多女性会选择不结婚。与此相反，另一种观点认为职业女性的增加会使结婚的人数也增加。作者显然赞成后一种观点。职业女性能提高家庭的收入和生活标准，因此有助于家庭情感的稳固。从心理因素考虑，职业女性在工作上的成就感也有利于家庭关系的稳定。女性成为家庭经济收入的主力军能提高她们在家里的地位，并有里利于婚姻中男女的平等。
26.	B。词汇猜意考查题。portend v. 预示，预兆;根据第一段第一句的句意可推断正确答案为B.
27.	D。细节判断题。答题依据为第一段倒数底二句话。数据表明在经济衰退时，许多人因为无法负担组建家庭或因为对未来的困难没有把握而不结婚。故D为正确答案。
28.	C。事实判断题。答题依据为第三段最后一句话。女性在工作上的成就感有利于婚姻关系的稳定。故C为正确答案。
29.	A。细节推断题。答题依据为第三段第二句话。女性没有工作会有被囚禁在家的感受，她会选择离婚作为解救自己的唯一出路。故A为正确答案。
30.	D。文章主旨判断题。整段文章的主旨可从最后一句话看出。故D为正确答案。
Passage Three
【短文大意】本文介绍了对普遍人性观点的三种挑战。大多数哲学家认为人性将人与动物区分开来，人性使人成为理性的存在。但近来由于三种新的观点，这种传统观点受到质疑。第一种新视角就是历史研究方法。该方法认为远古人与现代人相去甚远。美国人类学家的研究也赞成历史研究方法，人类学家认为人类生下来就像一张白纸等待文化的涂写。第二种新视角认为所谓“人性”的说法不过是为人类非人道的行为做掩护，如亚里士多德利用“人性”为奴隶制作辩护。第三种挑战来自于进化论。一旦人被视为处于不断进化的过程当中，普遍人性的观点自然就站不住脚。
31.	B。纵观全文得出对普遍人性这一看法的挑战主要来自历史研究观点。而题干是问对“人性”的挑战主要来自何种观点。故B为正确答案。
32.	C。细节判断题。答题依据为第二段第四句。对远古民族的研究揭示了人类风俗、价值观、感情和思想的多样性，因此许多考古学家认为人类出生时像一张白纸，真正起决定作用的是文化。言外之意没有固定不变的人性。故C为正确答案。
33.	B。事实判断题。答题依据为第二段第五句。作者以亚里士多德为例说明有些哲学家用“人性”的名义作为掩护人类罪恶的幌子。故B为正确答案。
34.	D。词汇猜意考查题。untenable adj. 站不住脚的，无法辩护的。根据本句上下文可知正确答案为D.
35.	A。细节题。答案可从第一段看出。

Part IV Error Correction
71.	being → been现在完成时的进行时态为have been + 现在分词。
72.	their → its此处代词代名词 population为单数，所以代词应是its而非their.
73.	relative → relatively修饰形容词isolated 应为副词relatively而非形容词relative.
74.	good → poor/bad句首用了Except for,显然是指不好的事情，故这里应将good 改为bad或poor.
75.	even as if → even if此处考查固定短语even if,即使。as if 仿佛。根据上下文应为即使世界人口到21世纪中叶增长两倍。
76.	politics → political此处and连接三个并列的形容词economic, environmental,和politic. politics是名词，political才是形容词政治的。
77.	by → for此处考查固定短语。for instance 例如,没有for instance.
78.	double → doubled此处应为现在完成时态，have more than doubled corn and wheat yields,意为在试验中，进口种子、肥料和先进的种植技术使玉米和小麦的产量增长了两倍多。
79.	few → fewer此处and 连接两个并列的形容词比较级，所以把few改为fewer.
80.	crop → crops crop指“庄稼”时，常用复数形式crops；作单数时，意为“产量”。
Part V Writing
Reduce Waste on Campus
Nowadays, waste is quite prevalent and serious on campus. Food is thrown away simply because it doesn’t taste good. Newspapers and magazines are discarded, because they have been read. What is worse, students seem to be quite accustomed to such waste and don’t have a feeling of guilt.
Waste can do much harm. Our country has the largest population in the world and suffers from a shortage of natural resources. It is crucial for us to make full use of what we have, or else, the resources will soon run out, and we will have nothing left for the next generations. Waste is certainly making matters worse.
Second, waste may contribute to a habit of extravagance, which is not good at all. We Chinese people have the good tradition of being economic, and are indignant about waste of any kind.
Therefore, all of us should reduce waste. We can try to eat up a meal. We may give our old books to those who need them, instead of throwing them away. Also, we should form the notion that waste is quite shameful. As long as all of us take action, waste will surely be reduced.

Section B
Passage One
The Golden Gate Bridge joins the beautiful city of San Francisco with the suburbs to the north. Each day about one hundred thousand automobiles cross the bridge taking people to and from the city. More than half of them cross the bridge during the morning and evening rush hours. When traffic is so heavy the trip is not pleasant. Now, however, there is at least one group of happy commuters. These are the people who travel under the bridge instead of on it. They go to work by boat and enjoy it so much that most of them say they will never go by car again. The ferry they take is spacious, quiet and comfortable. Commuters can enjoy the sun on deck. In the morning they can have breakfast in the coffee shop. And in the evening they can order a drink in the bar while looking at the beautiful scenery. The trip takes only 30 minutes and is not very costly. Best of all, being on a boat seems to make people more friendly toward each other. There has already been a marriage of two commuters who met on the ferry. Because the ferry has been so successful, there are plans to use other still larger boats. The re is also a proposal for a high speed boat that will make the trip in only 15 minutes. But not everyone is happy about that. A lot of people feel that half an hour is just enough time to relax.
11.	According to the speaker how do commuters feel about crossing the Golden Gate Bridge by car?
12.	What does the speaker say about ferry commuters?
13.	How do commuters respond to plans for the future of the ferry?
Passage Two
How many teeth have you had filled in the past two years? If you follow the adv ice of Dr. Faustick, you may be able to reduce the number of your visits to a dentist. Dr. Faustick conducted a two-year survey to find out how to prevent or re duce dental decay. 946 students took part in an experiment. 523 students cleaned their teeth within ten minutes of eating: when possible they used a toothbrush, when this was impossible they washed their mouth thoroughly with water. The remaining 423 students merely cleaned their teeth when they went to bed and when they got up in the morning. All the students had their teeth X-rayed at the end of the first and second years. At the end of the first year, the night and morning group had three times as many decayed teeth as the clean after each meal group. At the end of the second year the latter group had 53 percent fewer decayed teeth than the former group. Dr. Faustick has cleaned his teeth after meal for thirteen years and has not had a single decayed tooth. He pointed out that sugar is a major agent in dental decay. Particularly the sugar in sweets, cakes, and soft drinks. Ideally you should keep a tooth brush in your pocket and use it immediately after you have finished eating. When this is impractical you can at least make sure that you have a drink of water and let the water through your teeth to force out any particles of food. 7 out of 10 people loose at least ha lf of their teeth by the time they are fifty. Many have a complete set of false teeth by that time. In any case neither toothache nor a visit to a dentist is very pleasant. So it is worthwhile making an effort to keep you own teeth as long as possible. The main preventative agent is simply water.
14.	According to the passage what kind of food is most likely to cause dental decay?
15.	What does the passage tell us about the condition of Dr. Faustick’s teeth?
16.	What does Dr. Faustick suggest to prevent dental decay?
Passage Three
The worldwide Organization of the Red Cross stems from the ideal of Henri Dunant, a Swiss Banker. In 1838, at the age of ten, Dunant was taken by his father to visit a prison, there he saw prisoners chained together exercising in the yard and breaking stones along the road. This experience left a deep impression on him and made him determined to do something for convicts and slaves and for all who were oppressed and deprived of their liberty. On 24th June 1859 while on his way from Geneva to France, Dunant witnessed the battle between the French and Austrian armies. It was one of the fiercest battles of the 19th century. Shocked by the lack of medical supplies and attention given to the wounded, Dunant decided that a volunteer service had to be organized. He gathered together a number of women who attended to the hundreds of wounded soldiers of all nationalities and helped the surgeons as best they could. From that battle Dunant determined to form a body of people who would rally together in times of war and attend to the needs of wounded and dying. Dunant held that a suffering human being should be helped for his own sake only and without regard to race, religion, or political beliefs. Many European states supported him and on 22nd August 1864 the first Geneva Convention was signed. This lays down that once a soldier is wounded he and everyone else who comes to his help ceases to be an enemy. A symbol by which the relief workers could be recognized was devised. As a tribute to Switzerland, the symbol was the Swiss flag reversed. That is a red cross on a white ground. So the Red Cross was born.
17.	What first led Henri Dunant to think of helping the oppressed?
18.	What did Henri Dunant do during the battle between the French and Austrian armies?
19.	What was Henri Dunant’s belief when he founded the Red Cross?
20.	Why was the symbol of the Red Cross designed with a red cross on a white ground?

Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Given the lack of fit between gifted students and their schools, it is not surprising that such students often have little good to say ‘about their school experience. In one study of 400 adults who had achieved distinction in all areas of life, researchers found that three-fifths of these individuals either did badly in school or were unhappy in school. Few MacArthur Prize fellows, winners of the MacArthur Award for creative accomplishment, had good things to say about their precollegiate schooling if they had not been placed in advanced programs. Anecdotal (名人轶事) reports support this. Pablo Picasso, Charles Darwin, Mark Twain, Oliver Goldsmith, and William Butler Yeats all disliked school. So did Winston Churchill, who almost failed out of Harrow, an elite British school. About Oliver Goldsmith, one of his teachers remarked, “Never was so dull a boy.” Often these children realize that they know more than their teachers, and their teachers often feel that these children are arrogant, inattentive, or unmotivated.
Some of these gifted people may have done poorly in school because their gifts were not scholastic. Maybe we can account for Picasso in this way. But most fared poorly in school not because they lacked ability but because they found school unchallenging and consequently lost interest. Yeats described the lack of fit between his mind and school: “Because I had found it difficult to attend to anything less interesting than my own thoughts, I was difficult to teach.” As noted earlier, gifted children of all kinds tend to be strong-willed nonconformists. Nonconformity and stubbornness (and Yeats’s level of arrogance and self-absorption) are likely to lead to Conflicts with teachers.
When highly gifted students in any domain talk about what was important to the development of their abilities, they are far more likely to mention their families than their schools or teachers. A writing prodigy (神童) studied by David Feldman and Lynn Goldsmith was taught far more about writing by his journalist father than his English teacher. High-IQ children, in Australia studied by Miraca Gross had much more positive feelings about their families than their schools. About half of the mathematicians studied by Benjamin Bloom had little good to say about school. They all did well in school and took honors classes when available, and some skipped grades.
21.	The main point the author is making about schools is that ________.
A) they should enroll as many gifted students as possible
B) they should organize their classes according to the students’ ability
C) they are often incapable of catering to the needs of talented students
D) they should satisfy the needs of students from different family backgrounds
22.	The author quotes the remarks of one of Oliver Goldsmith’s teachers ________.
A) to show how poor Oliver’s performance was at school
B) to illustrate the strong will of some gifted children
C) to explain how dull students can also be successful
D) to provide support for his argument
23.	Pablo Picasso is listed among the many gifted children who ________.
A) could not cope with their studies at school successfully
B) paid no attention to their teachers in class
C) contradicted their teachers much too often
D) behaved arrogantly and stubbornly in the presence of their teachers
24.	Many gifted people attributed their success ________.
A) less to their systematic education than to their talent
B) mainly to parental help and their education at home
C) both to school instruction and to their parents’ coaching
D) more to their parents’ encouragement than to school training
25.	The root cause of many gifted students having bad memories of their school years is that ________.
A) they were seldom praised by their teachers
B) school courses failed to inspire or motivate them
C) their nonconformity brought them a lot of trouble
D) teachers were usually far stricter than their parents
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
It’s hardly news that the immigration system is a mess. Foreign nationals have long been slipping across the border with fake papers, and visitors who arrive in the U.S. legitimately often overstay their legal welcome without being punished. But since Sept. 11, it’s become clear that terrorists have been shrewdly factoring the weaknesses of our system into their plans. In addition to their mastery of forging passports, at least three of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers (劫机者) were here on expired visas. That’s been a safe bet until now. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) (移民归化局) lacks the resources, and apparently the inclination, to keep track of the estimated 2 million foreigners who have intentionally overstayed their welcome.
But this laxness (马虎) toward immigration fraud may be about to change. Congress has already taken some modest steps. The U.S.A. Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 tragedy, requires the FBI, the Justice Department, the State Department and the INS to share more data, which will make it easier to stop watch-listed terrorists at the border.
But what’s really needed, critics say, is even tougher laws and more resources aimed at tightening up border security. Reformers are calling for a rollback of rules that hinder law enforcement. They also want the INS to hire hundreds more border patrol agents and investigators to keep illegal immigrants out and to track them down once they’re here. Reformers also want to see the INS set up a database to monitor whether visa holders actually leave the country when they are required to.
All these proposed changes were part of a new border-security bill that passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate last week. Before Sept. 11, legislation of this kind had been blocked by two powerful lobbies: universities, which rely on tuition from foreign students who could be kept out by the new law, and business, which relies on foreigners for cheap labor. Since the attacks, they’ve backed off. The bill would have passed this time but for congressional maneuverings and is expected to be reintroduced and to pass next year.
Also on the agenda for next year: a proposal, backed by some influential law-makers, to split the INS into two agencies-a good cop that would tend to service functions like processing citizenship papers and a bad cop that would concentrate on border inspections, deportation and other functions. One reason for the division, supporters say, is that the INS has in recent years become too focused on serving tourists and immigrants. After the Sept, 11 tragedy, the INS should pay more attention to serving the millions of ordinary Americans who rely on the nation’s border security to protect them from terrorist attacks.
26.	Terrorists have obviously taken advantage of ________.
A) the irresponsibility of the officials at border checkpoints
B) the legal privileges granted to foreigners
C) the excessive hospitality of the American people
D) the low efficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
27.	We learn from the passage that coordinated efforts will be made by various U.S. government agencies to ________.
A) limit the number Of immigrants to the U.S.
B) prevent the forgery of immigration papers
C) ward off terrorist suspects at the border
D) refuse the renewing of expired visas
28.	It can be inferred from the passage that before Sept. 11, aliens with expired visas ________.
A) might stay on for as long as [hey wished
B) would be closely watched by FBI agents
C) would live in constant fear of deportation
D) might have them extended without trouble
29.	It is believed by many that all these years the INS ________.
A) has been serving two contradictory functions
B) has ignored the pleas of the two powerful lobbies
C) has over-emphasized its service functions at the expense of the nation’s security
D) has been too liberal in granting visas to tourists and immigrants indiscriminately
30.	Before Sept. 11, the U.S. Congress had been unable to pass stricter immigration laws because ________.
A) education and business circles cared little about national security
B) resources were not available for their enforcement
C) it was difficult to coordinate the efforts of the congressmen
D) they might have kept away foreign students and cheap labor
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
It was the worst tragedy in maritime (航海的) history, six times more deadly than the Titanic. When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes (鱼雷) fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II, more than 10,000 people-mostly women, children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany-were packed aboard. An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down. Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down. Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard. Most people froze immediately. I’ll never forget the screams,” says Christa Ntitzmann, 87, one of the 1,200 survivors. She recalls watching the ship, brightly lit, slipping into its dark grave-and into seeming nothingness, rarely mentioned for more than half a century.
Now Germany’s Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead, including more than 4,000 children-with his latest novel Crab Walk, published last month. The book, which will be out in English next year, doesn’t dwell on the sinking; its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later: “Nobody wanted to hear about it, not here in the West (of Germany) and not at all in the East.” The reason was obvious. As Grass put it in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche: “Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant, we didn’t have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings.”
The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable-and necessary. By unreservedly owning up to their country’s monstrous crimes in the Second World War, Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad, marginalize (使…不得势) the neo-Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors. Today’s unified Germany is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long, troubled history. For that, a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay. But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they’ ye now earned the right to discuss the full historical record. Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims, but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy.
31.	Why does the author say the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was the worst tragedy in maritime history?
A) It was attacked by Russian torpedoes.
B) It caused the largest number of casualties.
C) Most of its passengers were frozen to death.
D) Its victims were mostly women and children.
32.	Hundreds of families dropped into the sea when ________.
A) the badly damaged ship leaned toward one side
B) a strong ice storm tilted the ship
C) the cruise ship sank all of a sudden
D) the frightened passengers fought desperately for lifeboats
33.	The Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy was little talked about for more than half a century because Germans ________.
A) were eager to win international acceptance
B) had been pressured to keep silent about it
C) were afraid of offending their neighbors
D) felt guilty for their crimes in World War II
34.	How does Gunter Grass revive the memory of the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy?
A) By describing the ship’s sinking in great detail.
B) By giving an interview to the weekly Die Woche.
C) By presenting the horrible scene of the torpedo attack.
D) By depicting the survival of a young pregnant woman.
35.	It can be learned from the passage that Germans no longer think that ________.
A) the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy is a reasonable price to pay for the nation’s past misdeeds
B) Germany is responsible for the horrible crimes it committed in World War II
C) they will be misunderstood if they talk about the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy
D) it-is wrong to equate their sufferings with those of other countries
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
When we worry about who might be spying on our private lives, we usually think about the Federal agents. But the private sector outdoes the government every time. It’s Linda Tripp, not the FBI, who is facing charges under Maryland’s laws against secret telephone taping. It’s our banks, not the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that pass our private financial data to telemarketing firms.
Consumer activists are pressing Congress for better privacy laws without much result so far. The legislators lean toward letting business people track our financial habits virtually at will.
As an example of what’s going on, consider U.S. Bancorp, which was recently sued for deceptive practices by the state of Minnesota. According to the lawsuit, the bank supplied a telemarketer called Member Works with sensitive customer data such as names, phone numbers, bank-account and credit-card numbers, Social Security numbers, account balances and credit limits.
With these customer lists in hand, Member Works started dialing for dollars-selling dental plans, videogames, computer software and other products and services. Customers who accepted a “free trial offer” had 30 days to cancel. If the deadline passed, they were charged automatically through their bank or credit-card accounts. U.S. Bancorp collected a share of the revenues.
Customers were doubly deceived, the lawsuit claims. They, didn’t know that the bank was giving account numbers to MemberWorks. And if customers asked, they were led to think the answer was no.
The state sued MemberWorks separately for deceptive selling. The company denies that it did anything wrong. For its part, U.S. Bancorp settled without admitting any mistakes. But it agreed to stop exposing its customers to nonfinancial products sold by outside firms. A few top banks decided to do the same. Many other banks will still do business with MemberWorks and similar firms.
And banks will still be mining data from your account in order to sell you financial products, including things of little value, such as credit insurance and credit-card protection plans.
You have almost no protection from businesses that use your personal accounts for profit. For example, no federal law shields “transaction and experience” information-mainly the details of your bank and credit-card accounts. Social Security numbers are for sale by private firms. They’ve generally agreed not to sell to the public. But to businesses, the numbers are an open book. Self-regulation doesn’t work. A firm might publish a privacy-protection policy, but who enforces it?
Take U.S. Bancorp again. Customers were told, in writing, that “all personal information you supply to us will be considered confidential.” Then it sold your data to MemberWorks. The bank even claims that it doesn’t “sell” your data at all. It merely “shares” it and reaps a profit. Now you know.
36.	Contrary to popular belief, the author finds that spying on people’s privacy ________.
A) is practiced exclusively by the FBI
B) is more prevalent in business circles
C) has been intensified with the help of the IRS
D) is mainly carried out by means of secret taping
37.	We know from the passage that ________.
A) the state of Minnesota is considering drawing up laws to protect private information
B) most states are turning a blind eye to the deceptive practices of private businesses
C) legislators are acting to pass a law to provide better privacy protection
D) lawmakers are inclined to give a free hand to businesses to inquire into customers’ buying habits
38.	When the “free trial” deadline is over, you’ll be charged without notice for a product or service if ________.
A) you happen to reveal your credit card number
B) you fail to cancel it within the specified period
C) you fail to apply for extension of the deadline
D) you find the product or service unsatisfactory
39.	Businesses do not regard information concerning personal bank accounts as private because ________.
A) it is considered “transaction and experience” information unprotected by law
B) it has always been considered an open secret by the general public
C) its sale can be brought under control through self-regulation
D) its revelation will do no harm to consumers under the current protection policy
40.	We can infer from the passage that ________.
A) banks will have to change their ways of doing business
B) “free trial” practice will eventually be banned
C) privacy protection laws will soon be enforced
D) consumers’ privacy will continue to be invaded

Part IV Error Correction (15 minutes)
Directions:	This part consists of a short passage. In this passage, there are altogether 10 mistakes, one in each numbered line. You may have to change a word, add a word or delete a word. Mark out the mistakes and put the corrections in the blanks provided. If you change a word, cross it out and write the correct word in the corresponding blank. If you add a word, put an insertion mark (∧) in the right place and write the missing word in the blank. If you delete a word, cross it and put a slash (/) in the blank.
Example:
Culture refers to the social heritage of a people—the learned patterns for thinking, feeling and acting that characterize a population or society, include the expression of these patters in (S1) material things. Culture is compose of nonmaterial culture—(S2) abstract creations like values, beliefs, customs and institutional arrangements—and material culture—physical object like (S3) cooking pots, computers and bathtubs. In sum, culture reflects both the ideas we share or everything we make. In ordinary (S4) speech, a person of culture is the individual can speak another (S5) language—the person who is unfamiliar with the arts, music, (S6) literature, philosophy, or history. But to sociologists, to be human is to be cultured, because of culture is the common world (S7) of experience we share with other members of our group.
Culture is essentially to our humanness. It provides a kind (S8) of map for relating to others. Consider how you feel your way about social life. How do you know how to act in a classroom, or a department store, or toward a person who smiles or laugh (S9) at you? Your culture supplies you by broad, standardized, (S10) ready-made answers for dealing with each of these situations.
Therefore, if we know a person’s culture, we can understand and even predict a good deal of his behavior.

Part V Writing
[参考范文]
June 19, 2004
Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to reflect some problems I came across recently and, appeal to the improvement of the service industry.
This weekend I bought an English-Chinese dictionary in a bookstore near my home since its cover is elaborately designed. But when I went home and read carefully, I found that the several pages of the dictionary have been cracked and befouled. What is worse, the misprints spread everywhere in the dictionary and seriously affect my comprehension. Since there was such damage and misprint to the dictionary, I went to the bookstore to require for a replace. But to my surprise, the staff of the bookstore turn down my request rudely and even denied the poor quality of the dictionary.
It goes without saying that today’s face-paced and market-oriented economy calls for much higher standard for service industry. However, to my regret, many of the commercials fail to achieve this standard and the quality of the staff needs to be improved. It’s self-evident that the poor quality of practitioners in the service industry will not only deeply disappoint customers but also hamper the development of our country’s economy. As a result, I expect your newspaper to appeal to the service industry to attach more importance to the service improvement.
Thank you for your attention!
Sincerely yours,
Sam

1.	W: Oh, Dick. You are wearing a black jacket but yellow trousers. It’s the strangest combination I’ve ever seen.
M: I know. I got up late and dressed in a hurry. I didn’t realize my mistake until I entered the office.
Q: What does the woman think of the way Dick dressed?
2.	M: Excuse me. But has anyone turned in a brown leather wallet? I’ve lost my wallet. It contains my driver’s license and also some family pictures that are pretty important to me.
W: Oh, yes. We had a wallet brought in this morning. Wait here just a minute, please.
Q: What would the woman probably do?
3.	M: Excuse me, Madam. Is the air-conditioning on? This room is as hot as a furnace.
W: Sorry, sir. A new epidemic called SARS is threatening us right now. As a preventative measure, we are told to let in fresh air by opening the windows and not to use the air conditioners.
Q: What does the woman mean?
4.	M: You look quite different from what you used to.
W: Sure. I started exercising regularly two years ago and went from 253 pounds to a healthy 160 pounds and that is the only thing I did not give up halfway.
Q: What do we know about woman?
5.	M: I wonder if you find my experience relevant to the job.
W: Yes, certainly. But if only you had sent your application letter a week earlier.
Q: What does the woman imply?
6.	W: Shouldn’t someone go pick up the clothes form the laundry? They were ready three hours ago.
M: Don’t look at me, mom.
Q: What does the boy mean?
7.	M: Er... Hi, could you tell me where electronic products are displayed? I want to see some TVs, digital video cameras, DVD players, that sort of thing.
W: Well. Several countries are displaying electronic products. China’s selection is very large this year. You might as well go to the east wing first to take a look at a Chinese booth.
Q: Where is the conversation most probably taking place?
8.	M: Well, what did you think of the movie?
W: I don’t know why I let you talk me into going. I just don’t like violence. Next time you’d better choose a comedy.
Q: What can we infer from the conversation?
9.	W: Who do you think should get the job? How about Mr. Becket?
M: Mr. Becket? I’m not sure. He is a nice fellow, of course, and easy to get along with. But I doubt his professional expertise. I want someone who can get the job done.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation about Mr. Becket?
10.	M: Do you think home video players will replace movie theatres and force them out of the entertainment business?
W: We’re certainly faced with the grave challenge from the DVD industry. That’s why I think we have to revolutionize our concept of movie showing. As I see it, the movie theatre should not just be a place to watch a film, but a place to meet people.
Q: What does the woman think of the movie theatre?
Passage One
Few people can stand for the spirit of earlier America as much as Benjamin Franklin. He lived through almost the whole of the 18th century. He was born six years after the century began, and died ten years before it ended. During this time, he saw the American colonies grow from tiny settlements into a nation and he also contributed much to the new state. He was deeply interested in science and natural history and his experiments with electricity and lightning led directly to the invention of the lightning rod. He was also interested in improving the conditions of his fellow men. He was involved in a number of projects in his native Philadelphia, including the setting up of a library, and a university, a philosophical society and fire-prevention service. He worked hard to enable the American colonies to gain independence from Britain. As ambassador to France, he encouraged the French to help George Washington. After the war, he attended the American Constitutional Congress. This was his last contribution, for he died late that year. He is still fondly remembered by Americans as one of the creators of the United States.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	What did the speaker say about Benjamin Franklin?
12.	How did Franklin help George Washington?
13.	According to the passage, what is Franklin still well remembered as?
Passage Two
Yuppies are young people who earn a lot of money and live in a style that is too expensive for most people. If you’re invited to a yuppie dinner party, don’t be surprised if you’re offered freshly-cooked insects as a first course. While the idea of eating fried insects fills most of us with horror, insect-eating is becoming highly fashionable. For example, in the media industry, successful executives are often seen to eat fried or boiled insects from time to time while working at their desks. These safe-to-eat insects can be found and ordered on the Internet. And young people are logging on to exotic food websites and ordering samples of prepared insects to serve at their dinner parties. Although the idea of eating insects is probably disgusting to most of us, few people would claim that pigs, chickens, and some kind of seafood we often eat are examples of great beauty. One day, insects could be marketed and sold as food item in supermarket. According to their fans, they are not only high in protein and low in fat, but also very tasty. But until our attitudes to food change fundamentally, it seems that insect-eaters will remain a select few.
Questions 14 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	Why did the speaker say we might be surprised at the yuppie dinner party?
15.	Where can the people order the unusual food mentioned by the speaker?
16.	Why are some yuppies attracted by the unusual food?
17.	What does the speaker say about the future of this type of unusual food?
Passage Three
Many people dislike walking to the bank, standing in long lines and running out of checks. They are dissatisfied with that bank’s limited hours, too. They want to do some banking at nights and on weekends. For such people, their problems may soon be over. Before long, they may be able to do their banking from the comfort of their own home, any hour of the day, any day of the week. Many banks are preparing online branches or Internet offices, which means that people will be able to take care of much of their banking business through their home computers. This process is called “interactive banking”. At these online branches, customers will be able to view all their accounts, move money between their accounts, apply for a loan and get current information on product such as credit cards. Customers will also be able to pay their bills electrically and even email questions to their bank. Banks are creating online services for several reasons. One reason is that banks must compete for customers who will switch to another bank if they are dissatisfied with the service they receive. The convenience of online banking appeals to the kind of customer banks most want to keep. That is, people who are young, well-educated and have good incomes. Banks also want to take advantage of modern technology since they have moved to 21st century.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	What is one of the reasons for people’s dissatisfaction with traditional banks?
19.	What kind of customers does online banking most appeal to?
20.	Why do banks create online services according to the passage?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts, widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.
Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of Michigan State University, who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates U.S. educational practice in math or science.” The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”
The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual U.S. communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.
On average, U.S. students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.
For instance, eighth graders in the United States cover about 33 topics in math versus just 19 in Japan. Among science courses, the international gap is even wider. U.S. curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including Australia, Thailand, Iceland, and Bulgaria. Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.
The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington. “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”
Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.
In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards “face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声).”

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
I had an experience some years ago which taught me something about the ways in which people make a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I had to officiate at two funerals on successive days for two elderly women in my community. Both had died “full of years,” as the Bible would say; both yielded to the normal wearing out of the body after a long and full life. Their homes happened to be near each other, so I paid condolence (吊唁) calls on the two families on the same afternoon.
At the first home, the son of the deceased (已故的) woman said to me, “If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It’s my fault that she died.” At the second home, the son of the other deceased woman said, “If only I hadn’t insisted on my mother’s going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride, the abrupt change of climate, was more than she could take. It’s my fault that she’s dead.”
When things don’t turn out as we would like them to, it is very tempting to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Priests know that any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out badly, they believe that the opposite course-keeping Mother at home, postponing the operation—would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse?
There seem to be two elements involved in our readiness to feel guilt. The first is our pressing need to believe that the world makes sense, that there is a cause for every effect and a reason for everything that happens. That leads us to find patterns and connections both where they really exist and where they exist only in our minds.
The second element is the notion that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. It seems to be a short step from believing that every event has a cause to believing that every disaster is our fault. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. Psychologists speak of the infantile myth of omnipotence (万能). A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and summons the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely outgrow that infantile notion that our wishes cause things to happen.
26.	What is said about the two deceased elderly women?
A) They lived out a natural life.
B) They died due to lack of care by family members.
C) They died of exhaustion after the long plane ride.
D) They weren’t accustomed to the change in weather.
27.	The author had to conduct the two women’s funerals probably because ________.
A) he had great sympathy for the deceased
B) he wanted to console the two families
C) he was priest of the local church
D) he was an official from the community

A) they believe that they were responsible
B) they had neglected the natural course of events
C) they couldn’t find a better way to express their grief
D) they didn’t know things often turn out in the opposite direction
29.	In the context of the passage, “... the world makes sense” (Line 2, Para, 4) probably means that ________.
A) we have to be sensible in order to understand the world
B) everything in the world is predetermined
C) there’s an explanation for everything in the world
D) the world can be interpreted in different ways
30.	People have been made to believe since infancy that ________.
A) every story should have a happy ending
B) their wishes are the cause of everything that happens
C) life and death is an unsolved mystery
D) everybody is at their command
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
“I’ve never met a human worth cloning,” says cloning expert Mark Westhusin from his lab at Texas A&M University. “It’s a stupid endeavor.” That’s an interesting choice of adjective, coming from a man who has spent millions of dollars trying to clone a 13-year-old dog named Missy. So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and expect to clone a cat soon. They just might succeed in cloning Missy this spring—or perhaps not for another 5 years. It seems the reproductive system of man’s best friend is one of the mysteries of modern science.
Westhusin’s experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog’s eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos (胚胎) carrying Missy’s DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate (代孕的) mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted fetuses (胎) may be acceptable when you’re dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. “Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,” he says.
Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin’s phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. “A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,” says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy’s mysterious billionaire owner; he’s put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M’s research.
Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy’s fine qualities after she does die. The prototype is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy’s master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament. In a statement of purpose, Missy’s owner and the A&M team say they are “both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.”
Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs, nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.
However, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ “Why would you ever want to clone humans,Westhusin asks, “when we’re not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?”
31.	By “stupid endeavor” (Line 2, Para. 1), Westhusin means to say that ________.
A) human cloning is a foolish undertaking
B) animal cloning is absolutely impractical
C) human cloning should be done selectively
D) animal cloning is not worth the effort at all
32.	What does the first paragraph tell us about Westhusin’s dog cloning project?
A) Its success is already in sight.
B) It is doomed to utter failure.
C) It is progressing smoothly.
D) Its outcome remains uncertain.
33.	By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to ________.
A) examine the reproductive system of the dog species
B) find out the differences between Missy and its clones
C) search for ways to modify.its temperament
D) study the possibility of cloning humans
34.	We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have ________.
A) an abnormal shape
B) a bad temper
C) defective organs
D) immune deficiency
35.	It can be seen that present cloning techniques ________.
A) provide insight into the question of nature vs, nurture
B) have been widely used in saving endangered species
C) have proved quite adequate for the cloning of humans
D) still have a long way to go before reaching maturity
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Frustrated with delays in Sacramento, Bay Area officials said Thursday they planned to take matters into their own hands to regulate the region’s growing pile of electronic trash.
A San Jose councilwoman and a San Francisco supervisor said they would propose local initiatives aimed at controlling electronic waste if the California law-making body fails to act on two bills stalled in the Assembly. They are among a growing number of California cities and counties that have expressed the same intention.
Environmentalists and local governments are increasingly concerned about the toxic hazard posed by old electronic devices and the cost of safely recycling those products. An estimated 6 million televisions and computers are stocked in California homes, and an additional 6,000 to 7,000 computers become outdated every day. The machines contain high levels of lead and other hazardous substances, and are already banned from California landfills (垃圾填埋场).
Legislation by Senator Byron Sher would require consumers to pay a recycling fee of up to $30 on every new machine containing a cathode (阴极) ray tube. Used in almost all video monitors and televisions, those devices contain four to eight pounds of lead each. The fees would go toward setting up recycling programs, providing grants to non-profit agencies that reuse the tubes and rewarding manufacturers that encourage recycling.
A separate bill by Los Angeles-area Senator Gloria Romero would require high-tech manufacturers to develop programs to recycle so-called e-waste.
If passed, the measures would put California at the forefront of national efforts to manage the refuse of the electronic age.
But high-tech groups, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and the American Electronics Association, oppose the measures, arguing that fees of up to $30 will drive consumers to online, out-of-state retailers.
“What really needs to occur is consumer education. Most consumers are unaware they’re not supposed to throw computers in the trash,” said Roxanne Gould, vice president of government relations for the electronics association.
Computer recycling should be a local effort and part of residential waste collection programs, she added.
Recycling electronic waste is a dangerous and specialized matter, and environmentalists maintain the state must support recycling efforts and ensure that the job isn’t contracted to unscrupulous (毫无顾忌的) junk dealers who send the toxic parts overseas.
“The graveyard of the high-tech revolution is ending up in rural China,” said Ted Smith, director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. His group is pushing for an amendment to Sher’s bill that would prevent the export of e-waste.
36.	What step were Bay Area officials going to take regarding e-waste disposal?
A) Rally support to pass the stalled bills.
B) Lobby the lawmakers of the California Assembly.
C) Lay down relevant local regulations themselves.
D) Exert pressure on manufacturers of electronic devices.
37.	The two bills stalled in the California Assembly both concern ________.
A) the reprocessing of the huge amounts of electronic waste in the state
B) regulations on dumping hazardous substances into landfills
C) the funding of local initiatives to reuse electronic trash
D) the sale of used electronic devices to foreign countries
38.	Consumers are not supposed to throw used computers in the trash because ________.
A) this is banned by the California government
B) some parts may be recycled for use elsewhere
C) unscrupulous dealers will retrieve them for profit
D) they contain large amounts of harmful substances
39.	High-tech groups believe that if an extra $30 is charged on every TV or computer purchased in California, consumers will ________.
A) hesitate to upgrade their computers
B) abandon online shopping
C) buy them from other states
D) strongly protest against such a charge
40.	We learn from the passage that much of California’s electronic waste has been ________.
A) dumped into local landfills
B) exported to foreign countries
C) collected by non-profit agencies
D) recycled by computer manufacturers

The World Health Organization (WHO) says its ten-year campaign to remove leprosy (麻风病) as a world health problem has been successful. Doctor Brundtland, head of the WHO, says a number of leprosy cases around the world has (S1) been cut of ninety percent during the past ten years. She says (S2) efforts are continuing to complete end the disease. (S3)
Leprosy is caused by bacteria spread through liquid from the nose and mouth. The disease mainly effects the skin and (S4) nerves. However, if leprosy is not treated it can cause permanent damage for the skin, nerves, eyes, arms or legs. (S5)
In 1999, an international campaign began to end leprosy. The WHO, governments of countries most affected by the disease, and several other groups are part of the campaign. This alliance guarantees that all leprosy patients, even they (S6) are poor, have a right to the most modern treatment.
Doctor Brundtland says leprosy is no longer a disease that requires life-long treatments by medical experts. Instead, patients can take that is called a multi-drug therapy. This (S7) modern treatment will cure leprosy in 6 to 12 months, depend on the form of the disease. The treatment combines (S8) several drugs taken daily or once a month. The WHO has given multi-drug therapy to patients freely for the last five (S9) years. The members of the alliance against leprosy plan to target the countries which still threatened by leprosy. Among (S10) the estimated 600,000 victims around the world, the WHO believes about 70% are in India. The disease also remains a problem in Africa and South America.

Both John and Sue joined the staff of a successful public relations firm in New York during the same year. They had just completed their PR degrees at a nearby university and were thrilled to be hired by one of the finest PR firms in the city. John’s first assignment was to create a promotion campaign for a client who was putting a new game on the market. Initially Sue was assigned to work with a sportswear company on a marketing concept for its newest line of clothing. As time passed and work with their respective first clients became more and more difficult, John and Sue realized that they had been assigned two of the toughest clients in town. Although John completed his assignments quickly and successfully, he was furious when he learned that the boss had deliberately assigned him a difficult client. In response he not only complained to his colleagues but also to the boss’s secretary. Sue, on the other hand, had a more difficult time satisfying her first client and she took several additional months to actually complete the assignment. However, she just laughed when she heard that the boss had made the assignment purposely. Over the next two years, John worked reluctantly with each assignment and problem that he encountered. Sue accepted each assignment cheerfully. And when problems arose, she responded with her characteristic “No problem, I can handle it.” Although Sue took longer to complete her projects than John and both were equally successful on the assignments they completed, Sue was given the first promotion when there came a vacancy.
Questions 11 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	What’s the relationship between John and Sue now?
12.	Why was John furious after he finished his first assignment?
13.	What’s Sue’s attitude to difficult tasks?
14.	How does the story end?
Passage Two
American visitors to Eastern Asia are often surprised and puzzled by how Asian cultures and customs differ from those in the United States. What’s considered typical or proper social conduct in one country may be regard as odd, improper or even rude in the other. For example, people from some Eastern Asian countries may begin a conversation with a stranger by asking personal questions about family, home or work. Such questions are thought to be friendly, whereas they might be considered offensive in the United States. On the other hand, people in most Asian cultures are far more guarded about expressing their feelings publicly than most Americans are. Openly displaying annoyance or anger, yelling, arguing loudly and so forth is considered ill-mannered in countries such as Japan. Many Eastern Asians prefer to hold their emotions in check and instead express themselves with great politeness. They try not to be blunt and avoid making direct criticisms. In fact, they often keep their differences of opinion to themselves and merely smile and remain silent rather than engage in a confrontation. By comparison, Americans are often frank about displaying both positive and negative emotions on the street and in other public places. Americans visiting Asia should keep in mind that such behavior may cause offense. A major difference between Americans culture and most Eastern Asian cultures is that in Eastern Asia, the community is more important than the individual. Most Americans are considered a success when they make a name for themselves.
Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
15.	How would some Asians start their conversation when they meet for the first time?
16.	What would a Japanese do when he feels annoyed?
17.	What is encouraged in American culture according to the passage?
Passage Three
In order for a chemical to be considered a drug, it must have the capacity to affect how the body works. No substance that has the power to do this is completely safe. Drugs are approved only after tests have demonstrated that they are relatively safe when used as directed and when their benefits outweigh their risks. Thus some very dangerous drugs are approved because they are necessary to treat serious illnesses. Many people suffer ill effects from drugs called side effects, even though they take the drug exactly as directed. The human population contains a great variety of genetic variation, but drugs are tested on just a few thousand people. When a particular drug is taken by millions, some people may not respond in a predictable way, even though the drug has been tested. A patient may also acquire a tolerance for a certain drug, which means the patient has to take ever larger doses to produce the desired effect. Tolerance may lead to habituation, in which the person becomes so dependent on the drug that he or she becomes addicted to it. Addition causes severe psychological and physical disturbances when the drug is taken away. Finally, drugs often have unwanted side effects. This usually causes only minor discomfort, such as a skin rash, headache or sleepiness. Certain drugs, however, can produce serious adverse reactions.
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	Under what circumstances are drugs approved?
19.	Why do many people suffer side effects from a drug even though they take it as directed?
20.	What will happen when patients acquire a tolerance for a certain drug?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Passage One
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
Low-level slash-and-burn farming doesn’t harm rainforest. On the contrary, it helps farmers and improves forest soils. This is the unorthodox view of a German soil scientist who has shown that burnt clearings in the Amazon, dating back more than 1,000 years, helped create patches of rich, fertile soil that farmers still benefit from today.
Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because they lack minerals and because the heat and heavy rainfall destroy most organic matter in the soils within four years of it reaching the forest floor. This means topsoil contains few of the ingredients needed for long-term successful farming.
But Bruno Glaser, a soil scientist of the University of Bayreuth, has studied unexpected patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon. These soils contain lots of organic matter.
Glaser has shown that most of this fertile organic matter comes from “black carbon”—the organic particles from camp fires and charred (烧成炭的) wood left over from thousands of years of slash-and-burn farming. “The soils, known as Terra Preta, contained up to 70times more black carbon than the surrounding soil, “says Glaser.
Unburnt vegetation rots quickly, but black carbon persists in the soil for many centuries. Radiocarbon dating shows that the charred wood in Terra Preta soils is typically more than 1,000 years old.
“Slash-and-burn farming can be good for soils provided it doesn’t completely burn all the vegetation, and leaves behind charred wood,” says Glaser. “It can be better than manure (粪肥).” Burning the forest just once can leave behind enough black carbon to keep the soil fertile for thousands of years. And rainforests easily regrow after small-scale clearing. Contrary to the conventional view that human activities damage the environment, Glaser says: “Black carbon combined with human wastes is responsible for the richness of Terra Preta soils.”
Terra Preta soils turn up in large patches all over the Amazon, where they are highly prized by farmers. All the patches fall within 500 square kilometers in the central Amazon. Glaser says the widespread presence of pottery (陶器) confirms the soil’s human origins.
The findings add weight to the theory that large areas of the Amazon have recovered so well from past periods of agricultural use that the regrowth has been mistaken by generations of biologists for “virgin” forest.
During the past decade, researchers have discovered hundreds of large earth works deep in the jungle. They are up to 20 meters high and cover up to a square kilometer. Glaser claims that these earth works, built between AD 400 and 1400, were at the heart of urban civilizations. Now it seems the richness of the Terra Preta soils may explain how such civilizations managed to feed themselves.
11.	We learn from the passage that the traditional view of slash-and-burn farming is that ________.
A) it does no harm to the topsoil of the rainforest
B) it destroys rainforest soils
C) it helps improve rainforest soils
D) it diminishes the organic matter in rainforest soils
12.	Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because ________.
A) the composition of the topsoil is rather unstable
B) black carbon is washed away by heavy rains
C) organic matter is quickly lost due to heat and rain
D) long-term farming has exhausted the ingredients essential to plant growth
13.	Glaser made his discovery by ________.
A) studying patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon
B) examining pottery left over by ancient civilizations
C) test-burning patches of trees in the central Amazon
D) radiocarbon-dating ingredients contained in forest soils
14.	What does Glaser say about the regrowth of rainforests?
A) They take centuries to regrow after being burnt.
B) They cannot recover unless the vegetation is burnt completely.
C) Their regrowth will be hampered by human habitation.
D) They can recover easily after slash-and-burn farming.
15.	From the passage it can be inferred that ________.
A) human activities will do grave damage to rainforests
B) Amazon rainforest soils used to be the richest in the world
C) farming is responsible for the destruction of the Amazon rainforests

Passage Two
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
As a wise man once said, we are all ultimately alone. But an increasing number of Europeans are choosing to be so at an ever earlier age. This isn’t the stuff of gloomy philosophical contemplations, but a fact of Europe’s new economic landscape, embraced by sociologists, real-estate developers and ad executives alike. The shift away from family life to solo lifestyle, observes a French sociologist, is part of the “irresistible momentum of individualism” over the last century. The communications revolution, the shift from a business culture of stability to one of mobility and the mass entry of women into the workforce have greatly wreaked havoc on (扰乱) Europeans’ private lives.
Europe’s new economic climate has largely fostered the trend toward independence. The current generation of home-aloners came of age during Europe’s shift from social democracy to the sharper, more individualistic climate of American style capitalism. Raised in an era of privatization and increased consumer choice, today’s tech-savvy (精通技术的) workers have embraced a free market in love as well as economics. Modern Europeans are rich enough to afford to live alone, and temperamentally independent enough to want to do so.
Once upon a time, people who lived alone tended to be those on either side of marriage-twenty something professionals or widowed senior citizens. While pensioners, particularly elderly women, make up a large proportion of those living alone, the newest crop of singles are high earners in their 30s and 40s who increasingly view living alone as a lifestyle choice. Living alone was conceived to be negative-dark and cold, while being together suggested warmth and light. But then came along the idea of singles. They were young, beautiful, strong! Now, young people want to live alone.
The booming economy means people are working harder than ever. And that doesn’t leave much room for relationships. Pimpi Arroyo, a 35-year-old composer who lives alone in a house in Paris, says he hasn’t got time to get lonely because he has too much work. “I have deadlines which would make life with someone else fairly difficult.” Only an Ideal Woman would make him change his lifestyle, he says. Kaufmann, author of a recent book called “The Single Woman and Prince Charming,” thinks this fierce new individualism means that people expect more and more of mates, so relationships don’t last long-if they start at all. Eppendorf, a blond Berliner with a deep tan, teaches grade school in the mornings. In the afternoon she sunbathes or sleeps, resting up for going dancing. Just shy of 50, she says she’d never have wanted to do what her mother did-give up a career to raise a family. Instead, “I’ve always done what I wanted to do: live a self-determined life.”
16.	More and more young Europeans remain single because ________.
A) they are driven by an overwhelming sense of individualism
B) they have entered the workforce at a much earlier age
C) they have embraced a business culture of stability
D) they are pessimistic about their economic future
17.	What is said about European society in the passage?
A) It has fostered the trend towards small families.
B) It is getting closer to American-style capitalism.
C) It has limited consumer choice despite a free market.
D) It is being threatened by irresistible privatization.
18.	According to Paragraph 3, the newest group of singles are ________.
A) warm and lighthearted
B) on either side of marriage
C) negative and gloomy
D) healthy and wealthy
19.	The author quotes Eppendorf to show that ________.
A) some modern women prefer a life of individual freedom
B) the family is no longer the basic unit of society in present-day Europe
C) some professional people have too much work to do to feel lonely
D) most Europeans conceive living a single life as unacceptable
20.	What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
A) To review the impact of women becoming high earners.
B) To contemplate the philosophy underlying individualism.
C) To examine the trend of young people living alone.
D) To stress the rebuilding of personal relationships.
Passage Three
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Supporters of the biotech industry have accused an American scientist of misconduct after she testified to the New Zealand government that a genetically modified (GM) bacterium could cause serious damage if released.
The New Zealand Life Sciences Network, an association of pro-GM scientists and organisations, says the view expressed by Elaine Ingham, a soil biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, was exaggerated and irresponsible. It has asked her university to discipline her.
But Ingham stands by her comments and says the complaints are an attempt to silence her. “They’re trying to cause trouble with my university and get me fired,” Ingham told New Scientist.
The controversy began on 1 February, when Ingham testified before New Zealand’s Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, which will determine how to regulate GM organisms. Ingham claimed that a GM version of a common soil bacterium could spread and destroy plants if released into the wild. Other researchers had previously modified the bacterium to produce alcohol from organic waste. But Ingham says that when she put it in soil with wheat plants, all of the plants died within a week.
“We would lose terrestrial (陆生的) plants... this is an organism that is potentially deadly to the continued survival of human beings,” she told the commission. She added that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) canceled its approval for field tests using the organism once she had told them about her research in 1999.
But last week the New Zealand Life Sciences Network accused Ingham of “presenting inaccurate, careless and exaggerated information” and “generating speculative doomsday scenarios (世界末日的局面) that are not scientifically supportable”. They say that her study doesn’t even show that the bacteria would survive in the wild, much less kill massive numbers of plants. What’s more, the network says that contrary to Ingham’s claims, the EPA was never asked to consider the organism for field trials.
The EPA has not commented on the dispute. But an e-mail to the network from Janet Anderson, director of the EPA’s bio-pesticides (生物杀虫剂) division, says “there is no record of a review and/or clearance to field test” the organism.
Ingham says EPA officials had told her that the organism was approved for field tests, but says she has few details. It’s also not clear whether the organism, first engineered by a German institute for biotechnology, is still in use.
Whether Ingham is right or wrong, her supporters say opponents are trying unfairly to silence her.
“I think her concerns should be taken seriously. She shouldn’t be harassed in this way,” says Ann Clarke, a plant biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada who also testified before the commission. “It’s an attempt to silence the opposition.”
21.	The passage centers on the controversy ________.
A) between American and New Zealand biologists over genetic modification
B) as to whether the study of genetic modification should be continued
C) over the possible adverse effect of a GM bacterium on plants
D) about whether Elaine Ingham should be fired by her university
22.	Ingham insists that her testimony is based on ________.
A) evidence provided by the EPA of the United States
B) the results of an experiment she conducted herself
C) evidence from her collaborative research with German biologists
D) the results of extensive field tests in Corvallis, Oregon
23.	According to Janet Anderson, the EPA ________.
A) has cancelled its approval for field tests of the GM organism
B) hasn’t reviewed the findings of Ingham’s research
C) has approved field tests using the GM organism
D) hasn’t given permission to field test the GM organism
24.	According to Ann Clarke, the New Zealand Life Sciences Network ________.
A) should gather evidence to discredit Ingham’s claims
B) should require that the research by their biologists be regulated
C) shouldn’t demand that Ingham be disciplined for voicing her views
D) shouldn’t appease the opposition in such a quiet way
25.	Which of the following statements about Ingham is TRUE?
A) Her testimony hasn’t been supported by the EPA.
B) Her credibility as a scientist hasn’t been undermined.
C) She is firmly supported by her university.
D) She has made great contributions to the study of GM bacteria.
Passage Four
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Every fall, like clockwork, Linda Krentz of Beaverton, Oregon, felt her brain go on strike. “I just couldn’t get going in the morning,” she says. “I’d get depressed and gain 10 pounds every winter and lose them again in the spring.” Then she read about seasonal affective disorder, a form of depression that occurs in fall and winter, and she saw the light-literally. Every morning now she turns on a specially constructed light box for half an hour and sits in front of it to trick her brain into thinking it’s still enjoying those long summer days. It seems to work.
Krentz is not alone. Scientists estimate that 10 million Americans suffer from seasonal depression and 25 million more develop milder versions. But there’s never been definitive proof that treatment with very bright lights makes a difference. After all, it’s hard to do a double-blind test when the subjects can see for themselves whether or not the light is on. That’s why nobody has ever separated the real effects of light therapy from placebo (安慰剂) effects.
Until now. In three separate studies published last month, researchers report not only that light therapy works better than a placebo but that treatment is usually more effective in the early morning than in the evening. In two of the groups, the placebo problem was resolved by telling patients they were comparing light boxes to a new anti-depressant device that emits negatively charged ions (离子). The third used the timing of light therapy as the control.
Why does light therapy work? No one really knows. “Our research suggests it has something to do with shifting the body’s internal clock,” says psychiatrist Dr. Lewey. The body is programmed to start the day with sunrise, he explains, and this gets later as the days get shorter. But why such subtle shifts make some people depressed and not others is a mystery.
That hasn’t stopped thousands of winter depressives from trying to heal themselves. Light boxes for that purpose are available without a doctor’s prescription. That bothers psychologist Michael Terman of Columbia University. He is worried that the boxes may be tried by patients who suffer from mental illness that can’t be treated with light. Terman has developed a questionnaire to help determine whether expert care is needed.
In any event, you should choose a reputable manufacturer. Whatever product you use should emit only visible light, because ultraviolet light damages the eyes. If you are photosensitive (对光敏感的), you may develop a rash. Otherwise, the main drawback is having to sit in front of the light for 30 to 60 minutes in the morning. That’s an inconvenience many winter depressives can live with.
26.	What is the probable cause of Krentz’s problem?
A) An unexpected gain in body weight.
B) Unexplained impairment of her nervous system.
C) Weakening of her eyesight with the setting in of winter.
D) Poor adjustment of her body clock to seasonal changes.
27.	By saying that Linda Krentz saw the light” (Line 4, Para. 1), the author means that she ________.
A) learned how to lose weight
B) realized what her problem was
C) came to see the importance of light
D) became light-hearted and cheerful
28.	What is the CURRENT view concerning the treatment of seasonal depression with bright lights?
A) Its effect remains to be seen.
B) It serves as a kind of placebo.
C) It proves to be an effective therapy.
D) It hardly produces any effects.
29.	What is psychologist Michael Terman’s major concern?
A) Winter depressives will be addicted to using light boxes.
B) No mental patients would bother to consult psychiatrists.
C) Inferior light boxes will emit harmful ultraviolet lights.
D) Light therapy could be misused by certain mental patients.
30.	Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A) Winter depressives prefer light therapy in spite of its inconvenience.
B) Light therapy increases the patient’s photosensitivity.
C) Eye damage is a side effect of light therapy.
D) Light boxes can be programmed to correspond to shifts in the body clock.

2.	M: Jenny, remember this: a job worth doing at all is worth doing well.

Q: What does the woman mean?
Compound Dictation
Certain phrases one commonly hears among Americans capture their devotion to individualism. “Do you own thing.” “I did it my way.” “You’ll have to decide that for yourself.” “You made your bed, now lie in it.” “If you don’t look out for yourself, no one else will.” “Look out for number one.”
Closely associated with the value they place on individualism, is the importance American’s assign to privacy. Americans assume that people need some time to themselves or some time alone to think about things or to recover their spent psychological energy. Americans have great difficulty understanding foreigners who always want to be with another person who dislikes being alone.
If the parents can afford it, each child will have his or her own bedroom. Having one’s own bedroom even as an infant, fixes in a person the notion that she is entitled to a place of her own where she can be by herself, and keep her possessions. She will have her clothes, her toys, her books, and so on. These things will be hers, no one else’s.
Americans assume that people will have their private thoughts that might never be shared with anyone. Doctors, lawyers, psychologists and others have rules governing confidentiality that are intended to prevent information about their clients’ personal situations from being know to others.
American’s attitudes about privacy can be hard for foreigners to understand American’s houses, yards, and even their offices can seem open and inviting. Yet, in the minds of Americans, there are boundaries that other people are simply not supposed to cross. When those boundaries are crossed, an American’s body will visibly stiffen and his manner will be cool and aloof.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage one
Too many vulnerable child-free adults are being ruthlessly (无情的) manipulated into parent-hood by their parents, who think that happiness among older people depends on having a grand-child to spoil. We need an organization to help beat down the persistent campaigns of grandchildless parents. It’s time to establish Planned Grandparenthood, which would have many global and local benefits.
Part of its mission would be to promote the risks and realities associated with being a grandparent. The staff would include depressed grandparents who would explain how grandkids break lamps, bite, scream and kick. Others would detail how an hour of baby-sitting often turns into a crying marathon. More grandparents would testify that they had to pay for their grandchild’s expensive college education.
Planned grandparenthood’s carefully written literature would detail all the joys of life grand-child-free a calm living room, extra money for luxuries during the golden years, etc. Potential grandparents would be reminded that, without grandchildren around, it’s possible to have a conversation with your kids, who—incidentally—would have more time for their own parents.
Meanwhile, most children are vulnerable to the enormous influence exerted by grandchildless parents aiming to persuade their kids to produce children. They will take a call from a persistent parent, even if they’re loaded with works. In addition, some parents make handsome money offers payable upon the grandchild’s birth. Sometimes these gifts not only cover expenses associated with the infant’s birth, but extras, too, like a vacation. In any case, cash gifts can weaken the resolve of even the noblest person.
At Planned Grandparenthood, children targeted by their parents to reproduce could obtain non-biased information about the insanity of having their own kids. The catastrophic psychological and economic costs of childbearing would be emphasized. The symptoms of morning sickness would be listed and horrors of childbirth pictured. A monthly newsletter would contain stories about overwhelmed parents and offer guidance on how childless adults can respond to the different lobbying tactics that would-be grandparents employ.
When I think about all the problems of our overpopulated world and look at our boy grabbing at the lamp by the sofa, I wish I could have turned to Planned Grandparenthood when my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me.
If I could have, I might not be in this parenthood predicament (窘境). But here’s the crazy irony, I don’t want my child-free life back. Dylan’s too much fun.
21.	What’s the purpose of the proposed organization Planned Grandparenthood?
A) To encourage childless couples to have children.
B) To provide facilities and services for grandchildless parents.
C) To offer counseling to people on how to raise grandchildren.
D) To discourage people from insisting on having grandchildren.
22.	Planned Grandparenthood would include depressed grandparents on its staff in order to ________.
A) show them the joys of life grandparents may have in raising grandchildren
B) draw attention to the troubles and difficulties grandchildren may cause
C) share their experience in raising grandchildren in a more scientific way
D) help raise funds to cover the high expense of education for grandchildren
23.	According to the passage, some couples may eventually choose to have children because ________.
A) they find it hard to resist the carrot-and-stick approach of their parents
B) they have learn from other parents about the joys of having children
C) they feel more and more lonely ad they grow older
D) they have found it irrational to remain childless
24.	By saying “... my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me” (Line 2-3, Para. 6), the author means that ________.
A) her parents kept pressuring her to have a child
B) her parents liked to have a grandchild in their arms
C) her parents asked her to save for the expenses of raising a child
D) her parents kept blaming her for her child’s bad behavior
25.	What does the author really of the idea of having children?
A) It does more harm than good.
B) It contributes to overpopulation.
C) It is troublesome but rewarding.
D) It is a psychological catastrophe.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Ask most people how they define the American Dream and chances are they’ll say, “Success.” The dream of individual opportunity has been home in American since Europeans discovered a “new world” in the Western Hemisphere. Early immigrants like Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur praised highly the freedom and opportunity to be found in this new land. His glowing descriptions of a classless society where anyone could attain success through honesty and hard work fired the imaginations of many European readers: in Letters from an American Farmer (1782) he wrote. “We are all excited at the spirit of an industry which is unfettered (无拘无束的) and unrestrained, because each person works for himself ... We have no princes, for whom we toil (干苦力活)，starve, and bleed: we are the most perfect society now existing in the world.” The promise of a land where “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” drew poor immigrants from Europe and fueled national expansion into the western territories.
Our national mythology (神化) is full of illustration the American success story. There’s Benjamin Franklin, the very model of the self-educated, self-made man, who rose from modest origins to become a well-known scientist, philosopher, and statesman. In the nineteenth century, Horatio Alger, a writer of fiction for young boys, became American’s best-selling author with rags-to-riches tales. The notion of success haunts us: we spend million every year reading about the rich and famous, learning how to “make a fortune in real estate with no money down,” and “dressing for success.” The myth of success has even invaded our personal relationships: today it’s as important to be “successful” in marriage or parenthoods as it is to come out on top in business.
But dreams easily turn into nightmares. Every American who hopes to “make it” also knows the fear of failure, because the myth of success inevitably implies comparison between the haves and the have-nots, the stars and the anonymous crowd. Under pressure of the myth, we become indulged in status symbols: we try to live in the “right” neighborhoods, wear the “right” clothes, eat the “right” foods. These symbols of distinction assure us and others that we believe strongly in the fundamental equality of all, yet strive as hard as we can to separate ourselves from our fellow citizens.
26.	What is the essence of the American Dream according to Crevecoeur?
A) People are free to develop their power of imagination.
B) People who are honest and work hard can succeed.
C) People are free from exploitation and oppression.
D) People can fully enjoy individual freedom.
27.	By saying “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” (Line 10, Para. 1), the author means ________.
A) the more diligent one is, the bigger his returns
B) laborious work ensures the growth of an industry
C) a man’s business should be developed step by step
D) a company’s success depends on its employees’ hard work
28.	The characters described in Horatio Alger’s novels are people who ________.
A) succeed in real estate investment
B) earned enormous fortunes by chances
C) became wealthy after starting life very poor
D) became famous despite their modest origins
29.	It can be inferred from the last sentence of the second paragraph that ________.
A) business success often contributes to a successful marriage
B) Americans wish to succeed in every aspect of life
C) good personal relationships lead to business success
D) successful business people provide good care for their children
30.	What is the paradox of American culture according to the author?
A) The American road to success is full of nightmares.
B) Status symbols are not a real indicator of a person’s wealth.
C) The American Dream is nothing but an empty dream.
D) What Americans strive after often contradicts their beliefs.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Public distrust of scientists stems in part from the blurring of boundaries between science and technology, between discovery and manufacture. Most government, perhaps all governments, justify public expenditure on scientific research in terms of the economic benefits the scientific enterprise ha brought in the past and will bring in the future. Politicians remind their voters of the splendid machines ‘our scientists’ have invented, the new drugs to relieve old ailments (病痛), and the new surgical equipment and techniques by which previously intractable (难治疗的) conditions may now be treated and lives saved. At the same time, the politicians demand of scientists that they tailor their research to ‘economics needs’, that they award a higher priority to research proposals that are ‘near the market’ and can be translated into the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. Dependent, as they are, on politicians for much of their funding, scientists have little choice but to comply. Like the rest of us, they are members of a society that rates the creation of wealth as the greatest possible good. Many have reservations, but keep them to themselves in what they perceive as a climate hostile to the pursuit of understanding for its own sake and the idea of an inquiring, creative spirit.
In such circumstances no one should be too hard on people who are suspicious of conflicts of interest. When we learn that the distinguished professor assuring us of the safety of a particular product holds a consultancy with the company making it, we cannot be blamed for wondering whether his fee might conceivably cloud his professional judgment. Even if the professor holds no consultancy with any firm, some people many still distrust him because of his association with those who do, or at least wonder about the source of some his research funding.
This attitude can have damaging effects. It questions the integrity of individuals working in a profession that prizes intellectual honesty as the supreme virtue, and plays into the hands of those who would like to discredit scientists by representing then a venal (可以收买的). This makes it easier to dismiss all scientific pronouncements, but especially those made by the scientists who present themselves as ‘experts’. The scientist most likely to understand the safety of a nuclear reactor, for example, is a nuclear engineer declares that a reactor is unsafe, we believe him, because clearly it is not to his advantage to lie about it. If he tells us it is safe, on the other hand, we distrust him, because he may well be protecting the employer who pays his salary.
31.	What is the chief concern of most governments when it comes to scientific research?
A) Support from the votes.
B) The reduction of public expenditure.
C) Quick economics returns.
D) The budget for a research project.
32.	Scientist have to adapt their research to ‘economic needs’ in order to ________.
A) impress the public with their achievements
B) pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake
C) obtain funding from the government
D) translate knowledge into wealth
33.	Why won’t scientists complain about the government’s policy concerning scientific research?
A) They think they work in an environment hostile to the free pursuit of knowledge.
B) They are accustomed to keeping their opinions to themselves.
C) They know it takes patience to win support from the public.
D) They think compliance with government policy is in the interests of the public.
34.	According to the author, people are suspicious of the professional judgment of scientists because ________.
A) their pronouncements often turn out to be wrong
B) sometimes they hide the source of their research funding
C) some of them do not give priority to intellectual honesty
D) they could be influenced by their association with the project concerned
35.	Why does the author say that public distrust of scientists can have damaging effects?
A) It makes things difficult for scientists seeking research funds.
B) People would not believe scientists even when they tell the truth.
C) It may dampen the enthusiasm of scientists for independent research.
D) Scientists themselves may doubt the value of their research findings.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In many ways, today’s business environment has changed qualitatively since the late 1980s. The end of the Cold War radically altered the very nature of the world’s politics and economics. In just a few short years, globalization has started a variety of trends with profound consequences: the opening of markets, true global competition, widespread deregulation (解除政府对…的控制) of industry, and an abundance of accessible capital. We have experienced both the benefits and risks of a truly global economy, with both Wall Street and Main Street (平民百姓) feeling the pains of economic disorder half a world away.
At the same time, we have fully entered the Information Age, Starting breakthroughs in information technology have irreversibly altered the ability to conduct business unconstrained by the traditional limitations of time or space. Today, it’s almost impossible to imagine a world without intranets, e-mail, and portable computers. With stunning speed, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we work, shop, do business, and communicate.
As a consequence, we have truly entered the Post-Industrial economy. We are rapidly shifting from an economy based on manufacturing and commodities to one that places the greatest value on information, services, support, and distribution. That shift, in turn, place an unprecedented premium on “knowledge workers,” a new class of wealthy, educated, and mobile people who view themselves as free agents in a seller’s market.
Beyond the realm of information technology, the accelerated pace of technological change in virtually every industry has created entirely new business, wiped out others, and produced a Pervasive (广泛的) demand for continuous innovation. New product, process, and distribution technologies provide powerful levers for creating competitive value. More companies are learning the importance of destructive technologies—innovations that hold the potential to make a product line, or even an entire business segment, virtually outdated.
Another major trend has been the fragmentation of consumer and business markets. There’s a growing appreciation that superficially similar groups of customers may have very different preferences in terms of what they want to buy and how they want to buy it. Now, new technology makes it easier, faster, and cheaper to identify and serve targeted micro-markets in ways that were physically impossible or prohibitively expensive in the past. Moreover, the trend feeds on itself, a business’s ability to serve sub-markets fuels customers’ appetites for more and more specialized offerings.
36.	According to the first paragraph, the chances in the business environment in the past decades can be attributed to ________.
A) technological advances
B) worldwide economic disorder
C) the fierce competition in industry
D) the globalization of economy
37.	what idea does the author want to convey in the second paragraph?
A) The rapid development of information technology has taken businessmen by surprise.
B) Information technology has removed the restrictions of time and space in business transactions.
C) The Internet, intranets, e-mail, and portable computers have penetrated every corner of the world.
D) The way we do business today has brought about startling breakthroughs in information technology.
38.	If a business wants to thrive in the Post-Industrial economy, ________.
A) it has to invest more capital in the training of free agents to operate in a seller’s market
B) it should try its best to satisfy the increasing demands of mobile knowledgeable people
C) it should not overlook the importance of information, services, support, and distribution
D) it has to provide each of its employees with the latest information about the changing market
39.	In the author’s view, destructive technologies are innovations which ________.
A) can eliminate an entire business segment
B) demand a radical change in providing services
C) may destroy the potential of a company to make any profit
D) call for continuous improvement in ways of doing business
40.	With the fragmentation of consumer and business markets ________.
A) an increasing number of companies have disintegrated
B) manufacturers must focus on one special product to remain competitive in the market
C) it is physically impossible and prohibitively expensive to do business in the old way

Passage One
I had flown from San Francisco to Virginia to attend a conference on multiculturalism. Hundreds of educators from across the country were meeting to discuss the need for greater cultural diversity in the school curriculum. I took a taxi to my hotel. On the way, my driver and I chatted about the whether and the tourists. The driver was a White man in forties. “How long have you been in this country?” he asked. “All my life!” I replied, “I was born in the United States.” With strong southern accent, he remarked, “I was wondering because your English is excellent.” Then I explained as I had done many times before, “My grandfather came here from China in the 1880s. My family has been here in America for ever a hundred years.” He glanced at me in the mirror. Somehow, I didn’t look American to him. My appearance looked foreign. Questions liked the one my taxi driver asked make me feel uncomfortable. But I can understand why he could not see me as an American. He had a narrow but widely shared sense of the past: a history that has viewed Americans as descendants of Europeans. Race has functioned as something necessary to the construction of American character and quality in the creation of our national identity—American has been defined as “white”. But American has been racially diverse since our very beginning on the Virginia shore, where the first group of Englishmen and Africans arrived in the 17th century. And this reality is increasingly become visible everywhere.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	What was the theme of the conference the speaker was to attend?
12.	Why did the taxi driver ask the speaker how long he has been in the US?
13.	What message did the speaker wish to convey?
Passage Two
Laws have been written to govern the use of American National Flag, and to ensure proper respect for the flag. Custom has also governed the common practice in regard to its use. All the armed services have precise regulations on how to display the national flag. This may vary somewhat from the general rules. The national flag should be raised and lowered by hand. Do not raise the flag while it is folded. Unfold the flag first, and then hoist it quickly to the top of the flagpole. Lower it slowly and with dignity. Place no objects on or over the flag. Do not use the flag as part of a costume or athletic uniform. Do not print it upon cushions, handkerchiefs, paper napkins or boxes. A federal law provides that the trademark cannot be registered if it comprises the flag, or badgers of the US, When the flag is used to unveil a statue or monument, it shouldn’t serve as a covering of the object to be unveiled. If it is displayed on such occasions, do not allow the flag to fall to the ground, but let it be carried high up in the air to form a feature of the ceremony. Take every precaution to prevent the flag from soiled. It should not be allowed to touch the ground or floor, nor to brush against objects.
Questions 14 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	How do Americans ensure proper respect for the national flag?
15.	What is the regulation regarding the raising of the American National Flag?
16.	How should the American National Flag be displayed at an unveiling ceremony?
17.	What do we learn about the use of the American National Flag?
Passage Three
In some large American city schools, as many as 20-40% of the students are absent each day. There are two major reasons for such absences: one is sickness, and the other is truancy. That is staying away from school without permission. Since school officials can’t do much about the illness, they are concentrating on reducing the number of truancy. One of the most promising schemes has been tried in Florida. The pupils there with good attendance have been given free hamburgers, toys and T-shirts. Classes are told if they show improved rates of attendance, they can win additional gifts. At the same time, teachers are encouraged to inspire their students to come to school regularly. When those teachers are successful, they are also rewarded. “we’ve been punishing truancy for years, but that hasn’t brought them back to school,” One school principal said. Now we are trying the positive approach. Not only do you learn by showing up every day, but you earn. In San Francisco, the board of education has had a somewhat similar idea. Schools that show a decrease in deliberate destruction of property can receive the amount of money that would be spent on repairs and replacements. For example, 12,000 dollars had been set aside for a school’s property damages every year. Since repair expenses of damaged property required only 4,000 dollars, the remaining 8,000 dollars was turned over to the student activity fund. “Our democracy operates on hope and encouragement,” said the school board member. “Why not provide some positive goals for students and teachers to aim at?”
Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
18.	Which reason for students’ absences is discussed in great detail?
19.	Who will benefit from the scheme being tried in Florida?
20.	What measure has been taken in San Francisco to reduce the destruction of school property?

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
There are good reasons to be troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies, Television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what’s wrong with a society that presents videos of domestic violence as entertainment.
Most researchers agree that the causes of real-world violence are complex. A 1993 study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences listed “biological, individual, family, peer, school, and community factors” as all playing their parts.
Viewing abnormally large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality (因果关系). Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: “At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.”
Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out “the most doubtful measures of aggression”, only 28% supported a connection.
The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read ‘aggressive’ or ‘non-aggressive’ words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intent of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction.
Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society.
21.	Why is there so much violence shown in movies, TV and video games?
A) There is a lot of violence in the real world today.
B) Something has gone wrong with today’s society.
C) Many people are fond of gunplay and bloodshed.
D) Showing violence is thought to be entertaining.
22.	What is the skeptics (Line 3. Para. 3) view of media violence?
A) Violence on television is a fairly accurate reflection of real-world life.
B) Most studies exaggerate the effect of media violence on the viewers.
C) A causal relationship exists between media and real-world violence.
D) The influence of media violence on children has been underestimated.
23.	The author uses the term “alarmists” (Line 1. Para. 5) to refer to those who ________.
A) use standardized measurements in the studies of media violence
B) initiated the debate over the influence of violent media on reality
C) assert a direct link between violent media and aggressive behavior
D) use appropriate methodology in examining aggressive behavior
24.	In refuting the alarmists, the author advances his argument by first challenging ________.
A) the source and amount of their data
B) the targets of their observation
C) their system of measurement
D) their definition of violence
25.	What does the author think of the debate concerning the relationship between the media and violence?
A) More studies should be conducted before conclusions are drawn.
B) It should come to an end since the matter has now been settled.
C) The past studies in this field have proved to be misleading.
D) He more than agrees with the views held by the alarmists.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
You’re in trouble if you have to buy your own brand-name prescription drugs. Over the past decade, prices leaped by more than double the inflation rate. Treatments for chronic conditions can easily top $2,000 a month-no wonder that one in four Americans can’s afford to fill their prescriptions. The solution? A hearty chorus of “O Canada.” North of the border, where price controls reign, those same brand-name drugs cost 50% to 80% less.
The Canadian option is fast becoming a political wake-up call, “If our neighbors can buy drugs at reasonable prices, why can’t we? Even to whisper that thought provokes anger. “Un-American!” And-the propagandists’ trump card (王牌)—“Wreck our brilliant health-care system.” Supersize drug prices, they claim, fund the research that sparks the next generation of wonder drugs. No sky-high drug price today, no cure for cancer tomorrow. So shut up and pay up.
Common sense tells you that’s a false alternative. The reward for finding, say, a cancer cure is so huge that no one’s going to hang it up. Nevertheless, if Canada-level pricing came to the United States, the industry’s profit margins would drop and the pace of new-drug development would slow. Here lies the American dilemma. Who is all this splendid medicine for? Should our health-care system continue its drive toward the best of the best, even though rising numbers of patients can’t afford it? Or should we direct our wealth toward letting everyone in on today’s level of care? Measured by saved lives, the latter is almost certainly the better course.
To defend their profits, the drug companies have warned Canadian wholesalers and pharmacies (药房) not to sell to Americans by mail, and are cutting back supplies to those who dare.
Meanwhile, the administration is playing the fear card. Officials from the Food and Drug Administration will argue that Canadian drugs might be fake, mishandled, or even a potential threat to life.
Do bad drugs fly around the Internet? Sure-and the more we look, the more we’ll find, But I haven’t heard of any raging epidemics among the hundreds of thousands of people buying crossborder.
Most users of prescription drugs don’t worry about costs a lot. They’re sheltered by employee insurance, owing just a $20 co-pay. The financial blows rain, instead, on the uninsured, especially the chronically ill who need expensive drugs to live, This group will still include middle-income seniors on Medicare, who’ll have to dig deeply into their pockets before getting much from the new drug benefit that starts in 2006.
26.	What is said about the consequence of the rocketing drug prices in the U.S.?
A) A quarter of Americans can’t afford their prescription drugs.
B) Many Americans can’t afford to see a doctor when they fall ill.
C) Many Americans have to go to Canada to get medical treatment.
D) The inflation rate has been more than doubled over the years.
27.	It can be inferred that America can follow the Canadian model and curb its soaring drug prices by ________.
A) encouraging people to buy prescription drugs online
B) extending medical insurance to all its citizens
C) importing low-price prescription drugs from Canada
D) exercising price control on brand-name drugs
28.	How do propagandists argue for the U.S. drug pricing policy?
A) Low prices will affect the quality of medicines in America.
B) High prices are essential to funding research on new drugs.
C) Low prices will bring about the anger of drug manufacturers.
D) High-price drugs are indispensable in curing chronic diseases.
29.	What should be the priority of America’s health-care system according to the author?
A) To resolve the dilemma in the health-care system.
B) To maintain America’s lead in the drug industry.
C) To allow the vast majority to enjoy its benefits.
D) To quicken the pace of new drug development.
30.	What are American drug companies doing to protect their high profits?
A) Labeling drugs bought from Canada as being fakes.
B) Threatening to cut back funding for new drug research.
C) Reducing supplies to uncooperative Canadian pharmacies.
D) Attributing the raging epidemics to the ineffectiveness of Canadian drugs.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Age has its privileges in America. And one of the more prominent of them is the senior citizen discount. Anyone who has reached a certain age—in some cases as low as 55—is automatically entitled to a dazzling array of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life. Eligibility is determined not by one’s need but by the date on one’s birth certificate. Practically unheard of a generation ago, the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses—as common as color televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners.
People with gray hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them；yet, millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent (有支付能力的). Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans. The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that “elderly” and “needy” are synonymous (同义的). Perhaps that once was true, but today elderly Americans as a group have a lower poverty rate than the rest of the population. To be sure, there is economic diversity within the elderly, and many older Americans are poor, But most of them aren’t.
It is impossible to determine the impact of the discounts on individual companies. For many firms, they are a stimulus to revenue. But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense, directly or indirectly, of younger Americans. Moreover, they are a direct irritant in what some politicians and scholars see as a coming conflict between the generations.
Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits, which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old. Employment is another sore point, Buoyed (支持) by laws and court decisions, more and more older Americans are declining the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job-thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers.
Far from a kind of charity they once were, senior citizen discounts have become a formidable economic privilege to a group with millions of members who don’t need them.
It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others. Senior citizen discounts only enhance the myth that older people can’t take care of themselves and need special treatment； and they threaten the creation of a new myth, that the elderly are ungrateful and taking for themselves at the expense of children and other age groups. Senior citizen discounts are the essence of the very thing older Americans are fighting against-discrimination by age.
31.	We learn from the first paragraph that ________.
A) offering senior citizens discounts has become routine commercial practice
B) senior citizen discounts have enabled many old people to live a decent life
C) giving senior citizens discounts has boosted the market for the elderly
D) senior citizens have to show their birth certificates to get a discount
32.	What assumption lies behind the practice of senior citizen discounts?
A) Businesses, having made a lot of profits, should do something for society in return.
B) Old people are entitled to special treatment for the contribution they made to society.
C) The elderly, being financially underprivileged, need humane help from society.
D) Senior citizen discounts can make up for the inadequacy of the Social Security system.
33.	According to some politicians and scholars, senior citizen discounts will ________.
A) make old people even more dependent on society
B) intensify conflicts between the young and the old
C) have adverse financial impact on business companies
D) bring a marked increase in the companies revenues
34.	How does the author view the Social Security system?
A) It encourages elderly people to retire in time.
B) It opens up broad career prospects for young people.
C) It benefits the old at the expense of the young.
D) It should be reinforced by laws and court decisions.
35.	Which of the following best summarizes the author’s main argument?
A) Senior citizens should fight hard against age discrimination.
B) The elderly are selfish and taking senior discounts for granted.
C) Priority should be given to the economic needs of senior citizens.
D) Senior citizen discounts may well be a type of age discrimination.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In 1854 my great-grandfather, Morris Marable, was sold on an auction block in Georgia for $500. For his white slave master, the sale was just “business as usual.” But to Morris Marable and his heirs, slavery was a crime against our humanity. This pattern of human rights violations against enslaved African-Americans continued under racial segregation for nearly another century.
The fundamental problem of American democracy in the 21st century is the problem of “structural racism” the deep patterns of socio-economic inequality and accumulated disadvantage that are coded by race, and constantly justified in public speeches by both racist stereotypes and white indifference. Do Americans have the capacity and vision to remove these structural barriers that deny democratic rights and opportunities to millions of their fellow citizens?
This country has previously witnessed two great struggles to achieve a truly multicultural democracy.
The First Reconstruction (1865-1877) ended slavery and briefly gave black men voting rights, but gave no meaningful compensation for two centuries of unpaid labor. The promise of “40 acres and a mule (骡子)”was for most blacks a dream deferred (尚未实现的).
The Second Reconstruction (1954-1968), or the modern civil rights movement, ended legal segregation in public accommodations and gave blacks voting rights. But these successes paradoxically obscure the tremendous human costs of historically accumulated disadvantage that remain central to black Americans’ lives.
The disproportionate wealth that most whites enjoy today was first constructed from centuries of unpaid black labor. Many white institutions, including some leading universities, insurance companies and banks, profited from slavery. This pattern of white privilege and black inequality continues today.
Demanding reparations (赔偿) is not just about compensation for slavery and segregation. It is, more important, an educational campaign to highlight the contemporary reality of “racial deficits” of all kinds, the unequal conditions that impact blacks regardless of class. Structural racism’s barriers include “equity inequity.” the absence of black capital formation that is a direct consequence of America’s history. One third of all black households actually have negative net wealth. In 1998 the typical black family’s net wealth was $16,400, less than one fifth that of white families. Black families are denied home loans at twice the rate of whites.
Blacks remain the last hired and first fired during recessions. During the 1990-91 recession, African-Americans suffered disproportionately. At Coca-Cola, 42 percent of employees who lost their jobs were blacks. At Sears, 54 percent were black, Blacks have significantly shorter life spans, in part due to racism in the health establishment. Blacks are statistically less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or early-stage cancer surgery.

Until recently, dyslexia and other reading problems were a mystery to most teachers and parents. As a result, too many kids passed through school without master the printed page. (S1) Some were treated as mentally deficient: many were left functionally illiterate (文盲的)，unable to ever meet their potential. But in the last several years, there’s been a revolution in that we’ve learned about reading and dyslexia. (S2) Scientists are using a variety of new imaging techniques to watch the brain at work. Their experiments have shown that reading disorders are most likely the result of what is, in an effect, (S3) faulty wiring in the brain—not lazy, stupidity or a poor home (S4) environment. There’s also convincing evidence which dyslexia (S5) is largely inherited. It is now considered a chronic problem for some kids, not just a “phase”. Scientists have also discarded another old stereotype that almost all dyslexics are boys. Studies indicate that many girls are affecting as well (S6) and not getting help.
At same time, educational researchers have come up (S7) with innovative teaching strategies for kids who are having trouble learning to read. New screening tests are identifying children at risk before they get discouraged by year of (S8) frustration and failure. And educators are trying to get the message to parents that they should be on the alert for the first signs of potential problems.
It’s an urgent mission. Mass literacy is a relative new (S9) social goal. A hundred years ago people didn’t need to be good readers in order to earn a living. But in the Information Age, no one can get by with knowing how to read well and (S10) understand increasingly complex material.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A) B) C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Each summer, no matter how pressing my work schedule, I take off one day exclusively for my son. We call it dad-son day. This year our third stop was the amusement park, where be discovered that he was tall enough to ride one of the fastest roller coasters (过山车) in the world. We blasted through face-stretching turns and loops for ninety seconds. Then, as we stepped off the ride, be shrugged and, in a distressingly calm voice, remarked that it was not as exciting as other rides he’d been on. As I listened, I began to sense something seriously out of balance.
Throughout the season, I noticed similar events all around me. Parents seemed hard pressed to find new thrills for indifferent kids. Surrounded by ever-greater stimulation, their young faces were looking disappointed and bored.
Facing their children’s complaints of “nothing to do“, parents were shelling out large numbers of dollars for various forms of entertainment. In many cases the money seemed to do little more than buy transient relief from the terrible moans of their bored children. This set me pondering the obvious question:“ How can it be so hard for kids to find something to do when there’s never been such a range of stimulating entertainment available to them?”
What really worries me is the intensity of the stimulation. I watch my little daughter’s face as she absorbs the powerful onslaught (冲击) of arousing visuals and bloody special effects in movies.
Why do children immersed in this much excitement seem starved for more? That was, I realized, the point. I discovered during my own reckless adolescence that what creates excitement is not going fast, but going faster. Thrills have less to do with speed than changes in speed.
I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of years at these levels of feverish activity. It is no mystery to me why many teenagers appear apathetic (麻木的) and burned out, with a “been there, done that” air of indifference toward much of life. As increasing numbers of friends’ children are prescribed medications-stimulants to deal with inattentiveness at school or anti-depressants to help with the loss of interest and joy in their lives-I question the role of kids’ boredom in some of the diagnoses.
My own work is focused on the chemical imbalances and biological factors related to behavioral and emotional disorders. These are complex problems. Yet I’ve been reflecting more and more on how the pace of life and the intensity of stimulation may be contributing to the rising rates of psychiatric problems among children and adolescents in our society.
21.	The author tell surprised in the amusement park at fact that ________.
A) his son was not as thrilled by the roller coasters ride as expected
B) his son blasted through the turns and loops with his face stretched
C) his son appeared distressed but calm while riding the roller coasters

A) unless their parents can find new thrills for them
B) when they don’t have any access to stimulating fun games
C) when they are left alone at weekends by their working parents
D) even if they are exposed to more and more kinds of entertainment
23.	From his own experience, the author came to the conclusion that children seem to expect ________.
A) a much wider variety of sports facilities
B) activities that require sophisticated skills
C) ever-changing thrilling forms of recreation
D) physical exercises that are more challenging
24.	In Para 6 the author expresses his doubt about the effectiveness of trying to change children’s indifference toward much of life by ________.
A) diverting their interest from electronic visual games
B) prescribing medications for their temporary relief
C) creating more stimulating activities for them
D) spending more money on their entertainment

A) adjusting the pace of life and intensity of stimulation
B) promoting the practice of dad-son days

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
It used to be that people were proud to work for the same company for the whole of their working lives. They’d get a gold watch at the end of their productive years and a dinner featuring speeches by their bosses praising their loyalty. But today’s rich capitalists have regressed (倒退) to the “survival of the fittest” ideas and their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their stockholders but only to themselves. Instead of giving out gold watches worth a hundred or so dollars for forty or so years of word, they grab tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars as they sell for their own profit the company they may have been with for only a few years.
The new rich selfishly act on their own to unfairly grab the wealth that the country as a whole has produced. The top 1 percent of the population now has wealth equal to the whole bottom 95 percent and they want more. Their selfishness is most shamelessly expressed in downsizing and outsourcing (将产品包给分公司做) because these business maneuvers don’t act to created new jobs as the founder of new industries used to do, but only out jobs while keeping the money value of what those jobs produced for themselves.
To keep the money machine working smoothly the rich have bought all the politicians from the top down. The president himself is constantly leaving Washington and the business at the nation because he is summoned to “fundraising dinners” where fat cats pay a thousand or so dollars a plate to worm their way into government not through service but through donations of vast amounts of money. Once on the inside they have both political parties busily tearing up all the regulations that protect the rest of us from the greed of the rich.
The middle class used to be loyal to the free enterprise system. In the past, the people of the middle class mostly thought they’d be rich themselves someday or have a good shot at becoming rich. But nowadays income is being distributed more and more unevenly and corporate loyalty is a thing of the past. The middle class may also wake up to forget its loyalty to the so-called free enterprise system altogether and the government which governs only the rest of us while letting the corporations do what they please with our jobs. As things stand, if somebody doesn’t wake up, the middle class is on a path to being downsized all the way to the bottom of society.
26.	It can be inferred from the first paragraph that people used to place a high value on ________.
A) job security
B) bosses’ praise
C) corporate loyalty
D) retirement benefits
27.	The author is strongly critical of today’s rich capitalists for ________.
A) not giving necessary assistance to laid-off workers
B) maximizing their profits at the expense of workers
C) not setting up long-term goals for their companies
D) rewarding only those who are considered the fittest
28.	The immediate consequence of the new capitalists’ practice is ________.
A) loss of corporate reputation
B) lower pay for the employees
C) a higher rate of unemployment
D) a decline in business transactions
29.	The rich try to sway the policy of the government by ________.
A) occupying important positions in both political parties
B) making monetary contributions to decision-makers
C) pleasing the public with generous donations
D) constantly hosting fundraising dinners
30.	What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage?
A) to call on the middle class to remain loyal to the free enterprise system
B) to warn the government of the shrinking of the American middle class
C) to persuade the government to change its current economic policies
D) to urge the middle class to wake up and protect their own interests
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Intel chairman Andy Grove has decided to cut the Gordian knot of controversy surrounding stem cell research by simply writing a check.
The check, which he pledged last week, could be for as much as 55 million, depending on how many donors make gifts of between 550,000 and 5,500,000, which he has promised to match. It will be made out to the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF).
Thanks in part to such private donations, university research into uses for human stem cells—the cells at the earliest stages of development that can form any body part—will continue in California. With private financial support, the state will be less likely to lose talented scientists who would be tempted to leave the field or even leave the country as research dependent on federal money slows to glacial (极其缓慢的) pace.
Hindered by limits President Bush placed on stem cell research a year age, scientists are turning to laboratories that can carry out work without using federal money. This is awkward for universities, which must spend extra money building separate labs and keeping rigor cots records proving no federal funds were involved. Grove’s donation, a first step toward a $20 million target at UCSF, will ease the burden.
The president’s decision a year ago to allow research on already existing stem cell lines was portrayed as a reasonable compromise between scientists’ needs for cells to work with, and concerns that this kind of research could lead to wholesale creation and destruction of human embryos (胚胎), cloned infants and a general contempt for human life.
But Bush’s effort to please both sides ended up pleasing neither. And it certainly didn’t provide the basis for cutting edge research. Of the 78 existing stem cell lines which Bush said are all that science would ever need, only one is in this country (at the University of Wisconsin) and only five are ready for distribution to researchers. All were grown in conjunction with mouse cells, making future therapeutic (治疗的) uses unlikely.
The Bush administration seems bent on satisfying the small but vocal group of Americans who oppose stem cell research under any conditions. Fortunately, Grove and others are more interested in advancing scientific research that could benefit the large number of Americans who suffer from Parkinson’s disease, nerve injuries, heart diseases and many other problems.
31.	When Andy Grove decided to cut the Gordian knot, he meat to ________.
A) put an end to stem cell research
B) end Intel’s relations with Gordian
C) settle the dispute on stem cell research quickly
D) expel Gordian from stem cell research for good
32.	For UCSF to carry on stem cell research, new funds have to come from ________.
A) interested businesses and individuals
B) the United States federal government
C) a foundation set up by the Intel Company
D) executives of leading American companies
33.	As a result of the limit Bust placed on stem cell research. American universities will ________.
A) conduct the research in laboratories overseas
B) abandon the research altogether in the near future
C) have to carry out the research secretly
D) have to raise money to build separate labs
34.	We may infer from the passage that future therapeutic uses of stem cells will be unlikely unless ________.
A) human stem cells are used in the research
B) a lot more private donations can be secured
C) more federal money is used for the research
D) talented scientists are involved in the research
35.	The reason lying behind President Bush’s placing limits on stem cell research is that ________.
A) his administration is financially pinched
B) he did not want to offend its opponents
C) it amounts to a contempt for human life
D) it did not promise any therapeutic value
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
This looks like the year that hard-pressed tenants in California will relief-not just in the marketplace, where tents have eased, but from the state capital Sacramento.
Two significant tenant reforms stand a good chance of passage. One bill, which will give more time to tenants being evicted (逐出), will soon be heading to the governor’s desk. The other, protecting security deposits, faces a vote in the Senate on Monday.
For more than a century, landlords in California have been able to force tenants out with only 30 days’ notice. That will now double under SB 1403, which got through the Assembly recently. The new protection will apply only to renters who have been in an apartment for at least a year.
Even 60 days in a tight housing market won’t be long enough for some families to find an apartment near where their kids go to school. But is will be an improvement in cities like San Jose, where renters rights groups charge that unscrupulous (不择手段的) landlords have kicked out tenants on short notice to put up tents.
The California Landlords Association argued that landlords shouldn’t have to wait 60 days to get rid of problem tenants. But the bill gained support when a Japanese real estate investor sent out 30-day eviction notices to 550 families renting homes in Sacramento and Santa Rosa. The landlords lobby eventually dropped its opposition and instead turned its forces against AB 2330, regarding security deposits.
Sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden of San Francisco, the bill would establish a procedure and a timetable for tenants to get back security deposits.
Some landlords view security deposits as a free month’s rent, theirs for the taking. In most cases, though, there are honest disputes over damages-what constitutes ordinary wear and tear
AB 2330 would give a tenant the right to request a walk-through with the landlord and to make the repairs before moving out; reputable landlords already do this. It would increase the penalty for failing to return a deposit.
The original bill would have required the landlord to pay interest on the deposit. The landlords lobby protested that it would involve too much paperwork over too little money-less than $10 a year on a $1,000 deposit, at current rates. On Wednesday, the sponsor dropped the interest section to increase the chance of passage.
Even in its amended form, AB 2330 is, like SB 1403, vitally important for tenants and should be made state law.
36.	We learn from the passage that SB 1403 will benefit ________.
A) long-term real estate investors
B) short-term tenants in Sacramento
C) landlords in the State of California
D) tenants renting a house over a year
37.	A 60-day notice before eviction may not be early enough for renters because ________.
A) moving house is something difficult to arrange
B) appropriate housing may not be readily available
C) more time is needed for their kids’ school registration
D) the furnishing of the new house often takes a long time
38.	Very often landlords don’t return tenants’ deposits on the pretext that ________.
A) their rent has not been paid in time
B) there has been ordinary wear and tear
C) tenants have done damage to the house
D) the 30-day notice for moving out is over
39.	Why did the sponsor of the AB 2330 bill finally give in on the interest section?
A) To put an end to a lengthy argument.
B) To urge landlords to lobby for its passage.
C) To cut down the heavy paperwork for its easy passage.
D) To make it easier for the State Assembly to pass the bill.
40.	It can be learned from the passage that ________.
A) both bills are likely to be made state laws
B) neither bill will pass through the Assembly
C) AB 2330 stands a better chance of passage

The most important starting point for improving the understanding of silence is undoubtedly an adequate scientific education at school. Public attitudes towards science owe much the way science is taught in these (S1) institutions. Today, school is what most people come into (S2) contact with a formal instruction and explanation of science for the first time, at least in a systematic way. It is at this point which the foundations are laid for an interest in science. (S3) What is taught (and how) in this first encounter will largely determine an individual’s view of the subject in adult life.
Understanding the original of the negative attitudes (S4) towards science may help us to modify them. Most education system neglect exploration, understanding and reflection. (S5) Teachers in schools tend to present science as a collection of facts, often by more detail than necessary. As a result, (S6) children memorize processes such as mathematical formulas or the periodic table, only to forget it shortly afterwards. The (S7) task of learning facts and concepts, one at a time, makes learning laborious, boring and efficient. Such a purely (S8) empirical approach, which consists of observation and description, is also, in a sense, unscientific or incomplete. There is therefore a need for resources and methods of teaching that facilitates a deep understanding of science in (S9) an enjoyable way. Science should not only be “fun” in the same way as playing a video game, but ‘hard fun’—deep feeling of connection made possibly only imaginative (S10) engagement.

Passage one
You have probably heard of the DuPont Company, which was founded by a family of the same name. But do you know about the museum that one of the family members began? Henry Francis DuPont was an heir to Delaware’s DuPont Company fortune. He was one of the first serious collectors of American decorative art objects: furniture, textiles, paintings and other objects made in United States between 1640 and 1840. American furniture and household objects had been considered inferior to those from Europe. But DuPont helped developed a new appreciation for American decorative arts. He created a legendary show plays for these objects on his family estate just outside Wilmington, Delaware. In 1951, it was open to the public as the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum. The museum assembled objects from DuPont’s collection into 175 period rooms, each with examples of American antiques and decorative arts that followed a certain theme of period in early American history. For example, the DuPont dining room has furniture dating from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. And because this was the time when the United States became a new nation, there’s a patriotic theme in the room. Another example is the Chinese parlor, which has furnishings that would reflect American’s fascination with Asian culture during the 18th century. In these period rooms, DuPont believed he could tell the story of the early United States through furniture and other decorative arts.
Questions 11 to 13 are based on the passage you have just heard.
11.	What is Henry Francis DuPont noted for?
12.	What was the purpose of DuPont’s efforts?
13.	How were the objects on display arranged?
Passage Two
According to David Grattle, a British language expert, the idea that English will become the world language is outdated. And people are more likely to switch between two or more languages for routine communication in the future. The share of the world’s population that speaks English as a native language is falling. Instead, English will play a growing role as a second language. A population speaking more than one language is already the case in much of the world and is becoming more common in the United States. Indeed, the census bureau reported last year that nearly one American in five speaks a language other than English at home, with Spanish taking the lead, followed by Chinese. Grattle works for British consulting and publishing business. He anticipates a world with the share of people who are native English speakers slips from 9% in the mid 1990s to 5% in 2050. Grattle says, “Up until 1995, English was the second most common native tongue in the world, trailing only Chinese. By 2050, Chinese will continue its predominance with Hindi Woodoo of India and Arabic climbing past English and Spanish nearly equal to it.” In contrast, an American language expert, David Harrison noted that the global share of English is much larger if you count second language speakers, and will continue to rise even as the proportion of native speakers declines. Harrison disputed listing Arabic in top three languages because varieties of Arabic spoken in such countries as Egypt and Morocco are mutually incomprehensible.
Questions 14 to 16 are based on the passage you have just heard.
14.	What does David Grattle say about the use of languages for daily communication in the future?
15.	Why doesn’t David Harrison include Arabic as one of the top three languages?
16.	What can we infer from the passage?
Passage Three
There are about 1 million blind people in the United States. The largest and most influential organization of blind people in this country is the National Federation of the Blind. Its officials say the nation doesn’t have any colleges or universities that serve only blind students. They say the reason for this is that blind people must learn to live among people who can see. American colleges and universities do accept blind and visually impaired students, and they provide services to help these students succeed. For example, colleges find people who write down what the professor say in class and they provide technology that can help blind students with their work. However, experts say colleges can best help blind students by making it clear that the students should learn to help themselves. One blind American student named T recently made news because he graduated from medical school from the University of Wisconsin. He said technology was one of the reasons he succeeded. He used a computer that read into his earphone what he was typing. He also used a small printer that permitted him to write notes about his patients in the hospital. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. National Federation of the Blind officials say blind students from other nations do come to the United States to attend college. Some can even get financial aid. The Federation awards about 30 scholarships each year that have no citizenship requirement.
Questions 17 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.
17.	According to officials of the National Federation of the Blind, why are there no special colleges for blind students only?
18.	According to experts how can colleges best help blind students?
19.	What is one of the reasons given by T as a blind student for his success?
20.	What can blind students from overseas do to study in America according to the National Federation of the Blind?

Space Tourism
Make your reservations now. The space tourism industry is officially open for business, and tickets are going for a mere $20 million for a one-week stay in space. Despite reluctance from National Air and Space Administration (NASA)，Russia made American businessman Dennis Tito the world’s first space tourist. Tito flew into space aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on April 30, 2001. The second space tourist, South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth, took off aboard the Russian Soyuz on April 25, 2002, also bound for the ISS.
Lance Bass of ‘N Sync was supposed to be the third to make the $20 million trip, but he did not join the three-man crew as they blasted off on October 30, 2002, due to lack of payment. Probably the most incredible aspect of this proposed space tour was that NASA approved of it.
These trips are the beginning of what could be a profitable 21st century industry. There are already several space tourism companies planning to build suborbital vehicles and orbital cities within the next two decades. These companies have invested millions, believing that the space tourism industry is on the verge of taking off.
In 1997, NASA published a report concluding that selling trips into space to private citizens could be worth billions of dollars. A Japanese report supports these findings, and projects that space tourism could be a $10 billion per year industry within the next two decades. The only obstacles to opening up space to tourists are the space agencies, who are concerned with safety and the development of a reliable, reusable launch vehicle.
Space Accommodations
Russia’s Mir space station was supposed to be the first destination for space tourists. But in March 2001，the Russian Aerospace Agency brought Mir down into the Pacific Ocean. As it turned out, bringing down Mir only temporarily delayed the first tourist trip into space.
The Mir crash did cancel plans for a new reality-based game show from NBC, which was going to be called Destination Mir. The Survivor-like TV show was scheduled to air in fall 2001, Participants on the show were to go through training at Russia’s cosmonaut (宇航员) training center, Star City. Each week, one of the participants would be eliminated from the show, with the winner receiving a trip to the Mir space station. The Mir crash has ruled out NBC’s space plans for now. NASA is against beginning space tourism until the International Space Station is completed in 2006.
Russia is not alone in its interest in space tourism. There are several projects underway to commercialize space travel. Here are a few of the groups that might take tourists to space:
●	Space Island Group is going to build a ring-shaped, rotating “commercial space infrastructure (基础结构)” that will resemble the Discovery spacecraft in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Space Island says it will build its space city out of empty NASA space-shuttle fuel tanks (to start, it should take around 12 or so), and place it about 400 miles above Earth. The space city will rotate once per minute to create a gravitational pull one-third as strong as Earth’s.
●	According to their vision statement. Space Adventures plans to “fly tens of thousand of people in space over the next 10-15 years and beyond, around the moon, and back, from spaceports both on Earth and in space, to and from private space stations, and board dozen of different vehicles...”
●	Even Hilton Hotels has shown interest in the space tourism industry and possibility of building or co-funding a space hotel. However, the company did say that it believes such a space hotel is 15 to 20 years away.
Initially, space tourism will offer simple accommodations at best. For instance, if the International Space Station is used as a tourist attraction, guests won’t find the luxurious surroundings of a hotel room on Earth. It has been designed for conducting research, not entertainment. However, the first generation of space hotels should offer tourists a much more comfortable experience.
In regard to a concept for a space hotel initially planned by Space Island, such a hotel could offer guests every convenience they might find at a hotel on Earth, and some they might not. The small gravitational pull created by the rotating space city would allow space-tourists and residents to walk around and function facilities would be possible. Additionally, space tourists would even be able to take space walks.
Many of these companies believe that they have to offer an extremely enjoyable experience in order for passengers to pay thousands, if not millions, of dollars to ride into space. So will space create another separation between the haves and have-nots?
The Most Expensive Vacation
Will space be an exotic retreat reserved for only the wealthy? Or will middle-class folks have a chance to take their families to space? Make no mistake about it, going to space will be the most expensive vacation you ever take. Prices right now are in the tens of millions of dollars. Currently, the only vehicles that can take you into space are the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz, both of which are terribly inefficient. Each spacecraft requires millions of pounds of fuel to take off into space, which makes them expensive to launch. One pound of payload (有效载重) costs about $10,000 to put into Earth’s orbit.
NASA and Lockheed Martin are currently developing a single-stage-to-orbit launch space plane, called the VentureStar, that could be launched for about a tenth of what the space shuttle costs to launch. If the VentureStar takes off, the number of people who could afford to take a trip into space would move into the millions.
In 1998, a joint report from NASA and the Space Transportation Association stated that improvements in technology could push fares for space travel as low as $50,000, and possibly down to $20,000 or $10,000 a decade later. The report concluded that a ticket price of $50,000, there could be 500,000 passengers flying into space each year. While still leaving out many people, these prices would open up space to a tremendous amount of traffic.
Since the beginning of the space race, the general public has said, “Isn’t that great—when do I get to go?” Well, our chance might be closer than ever. Within the next 20 years, space planes could be taking off for the Moon at the same frequency as airplanes flying between New York and Los Angles.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions:	In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
I’ve heard from and talked to many people who described how Mother Nature simplified their lives for them. They’d lost their home and many or all of their possessions through fires, floods, earthquakes, or some other disaster. Losing everything you own under such circumstances can be distressing, but the people I’ve heard from all saw their loss, ultimately as a blessing.
“The fire saved us the agony of deciding what to keep and what to get rid of,” one woman wrote. And once all those things were no longer there, she and her husband saw how they had weighed them down and complicate their lives.
“There was so much stuff we never used and that was just taking up space. We vowed when we started over, we’d replace only what we needed, and this time we’d do it right. We’ve kept our promise: we don’t have much now, but what we have is exactly what we want.”
Though we’ve never had a catastrophic loss such as that, Gibbs and I did have a close call shortly before we decided to simplify. At that time we lived in a fire zone. One night a firestorm rages through and destroyed over six hundred homes in our community. That tragedy gave us the opportunity to look objectively at the goods we’d accumulated.
We saw that there was so much we could get rid of and only never miss, but be better off without. Having almost lost it all, we found it much easier to let go of the things we knew we’d never use again.
Obviously, there’s a tremendous difference between getting rid of possessions and losing them through a natural disaster without having a say in the matter. And this is not to minimize the tragedy and pain such a loss can generate.
But you might think about how you would approach the acquisition process if you had it to do all over again. Look around your home and make a list of what you would replace.
Make another list of things you wouldn’t acquire again no matter what, and in fact would be happy to be rid of.
When you’re ready to start unloading some of your stuff, that list will be a good place to start.

Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
In a purely biological sense, fear begins with the body’s system for reacting to things that can harm us—the so-called fight-or-flight response. “An animal that can’t detect danger can’t stay alive,” says Joseph LeDoux. Like animals, humans evolved with an elaborate mechanism for processing information about potential threats. At its core is a cluster of neurons (神经元) deep in the brain known as the amygdale (扁桃核).
LeDoux studies the way animals and humans respond to threats to understand how we form memories of significant events in our lives. The amygdale receives input from many parts of the brain, including regions responsible for retrieving memories. Using this information, the amygdale appraises a situation—I think this charging dog wants to bite me—and triggers a response by radiating nerve signals throughout the body. These signals produce the familiar signs of distress: trembling, perspiration and fast-moving feet, just to name three.
This fear mechanism is critical to the survival of all animals, but no one can say for sure whether beasts other than humans know they’re afraid. That is, as LeDoux says, “if you put that system into a brain that has consciousness, then you get the feeling of fear.”
Humans, says Edward M. Hallowell, have the ability to call up images of bad things that happened in the past and to anticipate future events. Combine these higher thought processes with our hardwired danger-detection systems, and you get a near-universal human phenomenon: worry.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, says Hallowell. “When used properly, worry is an incredible device,” he says. After all, a little healthy worrying is okay if it leads to constructive action—like having a doctor look at that weird spot on your back.
Hallowell insists, though, that there’s a right way to worry. “Never do it alone, get the facts and then make a plan.” He says. Most of us have survived a recession, so we’re familiar with the belt-tightening strategies needed to survive a slump.
Unfortunately, few of us have much experience dealing with the threat of terrorism, so it’s been difficult to get fact about how we should respond. That’s why Hallowell believes it was okay for people to indulge some extreme worries last fall by asking doctors for Cipro (抗炭疽菌的药物) and buying gas masks.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
Amitai Etzioni is not surprised by the latest headings about scheming corporate crooks (骗子). As a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School in 1989, he ended his work there disgusted with his students’ overwhelming lost for money. “They’re taught that profit is all that matters,” he says. “Many schools don’t even offer ethics (伦理学) courses at all.”
Etzioni expressed his frustration about the interests of his graduate students. “By and large, I clearly had not found a way to help classes full of MBAs see that there is more to life than money, power, fame and self-interest.” He wrote at the time. Today he still takes the blame for not educating these “business-leaders-to-be.” “I really like I failed them,” he says. “If I was a better teacher maybe I could have reached them.”
Etzioni was a respected ethics expert when he arrived at Harvard. He hoped his work at the university would give him insight into how questions of morality could be applied to places where self-interest flourished. What he found wasn’t encouraging. Those would be executives had, says Etzioni, little interest in concepts of ethics and morality in the boardroom—and their professor was met with blank stares when he urged his students to see business in new and different ways.
Etzioni sees the experience at Harvard as an eye-opening one and says there’s much about business schools that he’d like to change. “A lot of the faculty teaching business are bad news themselves,” Etzioni says. From offering classes that teach students how to legally manipulate contracts, to reinforcing the notion of profit over community interests, Etzioni has seen a lot that’s left him shaking his head. And because of what he’s seen taught in business schools, he’s not surprised by the latest rash of corporate scandals. “In many ways things have got a lot worse at business schools, I suspect,” says Etzioni.
Etzioni is still teaching the sociology of right and wrong and still calling for ethical business leadership. “People with poor motives will always exist.” He says. “Sometimes environments constrain those people and sometimes environments give those people opportunity.” Etzioni says the booming economy of the last decade enabled those individuals with poor motives to get rich before getting in trouble. His hope now: that the cries for reform will provide more fertile soil for his long-standing messages about business ethics.

Example:
Television is rapidly becoming the literature of our periods╱.	1. time/times/period Many of the arguments having╱ used for the study of literature as	2. _______\_______ a school subject are valid for ∧ study of television.	3. ______the______
The National Endowment for the Arts recently released the results of its “Reading at Risk” survey, which described the movement of the American public away from books and literature and toward television and electronic media. According to the survey, “reading is on the decline on every (62) region, within every ethnic group, and at every educational level.”
The day the NEA report released, the U.S. House, in a tie (63) Vote, upheld the government’s right to obtain bookstore and library records under a provision of the USA Patriot Act. The House proposal would have barred the federal government (64) from demand library records, reading lists, book customer lists and other material in terrorism and intelligence investigations.
These two events are completely unrelated to, yet they (65) echo each other in the message they send about the place of books and reading in American culture. At the heart (66) of the NEA survey is the belief in our democratic System depends on leaders who can think critically, analyze (67) texts and discussing books and literature. At the same time, through a provision of the Patriot Act, the leaders of our country are unconsciously sending the message that reading (68) may be connected to desirable activities that might undermine our system of government rather than helping democracy flourish.
Our culture’s decline in reading begin well before the (69) existence of the Patriot Act. During the 1980s’ culture wars, school systems across the country pulled some books from (70) library shelves because its content was deemed by parents and teachers to be inappropriate. Now what started in schools across the country is playing itself out on a nation stage and (71) is possibly having an impact on the reading habits of the American public.

M: Well, I had to see her a few times, but what impressed me most were the magazines in her waiting room.
Q: What does the woman imply?
12.	W: I’m afraid I can’t show you the apartment at the moment, because the tenant is still living in it. It’s really a lovely place, with a big kitchen and a sunny window, for only two hundred dollars a month.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
13.	M: So, that’s what’s been keeping you so busy recently!
W: Yes, I’ve been tied up with my studies. You know I’m planning to go to the United States this coming summer, but I’m a bit nervous about my English.
Q: What is the woman busy doing?
14.	W: How did you feel when you found out you had high blood pressure?
M: Shocked! The problem for me was that there were no symptoms; it seemed to have sneaked up on me.
Q: What does the man mean?
15.	W: So, you’re just back from a trip to India. What were you doing there?

Conversation One
W: Hello, Patrick, is that you?
M: Yeah Jane, what can I do for you?
W: I was calling about the apple tree that you were trimming yesterday.
M: That was hard work!
W: I’m sure it was. It sure looked difficult.
M: Yeah, I’m glad it’s finished. Hauling the branches to the front for garbage pick up was no fun either.
W: Well, I don’t think you’re quite finished yet, some of the larger branches fell over into my yard, and I think you should come and get them.
M: Listen Jane, I don’t see why I should do that. You eat all the apples that fall in your yard and you’ve never complained about that before.
W: Well, it’s easier to pick up apples then to drag tree branches all the way to the curb. My kids pick up the apples, and the branches are just too big for them to drag.
M: Well, I guess you’ll just have to do it yourself Jane.
W: Patrick, I wish you would reconsider. We’ve always gotten along fairly well, but I think you’re out of line here. The branches are your responsibility.
M: Sorry Jane, I disagree! You take the benefits of the apple tree, but refuse to deal with the bad side of it! Besides, it won’t take you any time to get the branches out front!
W: Get the branches off my property or I’ll have to sue you.
M: Yeah? For what?! You’re taking those law classes too seriously! I’ve gotta go, I have to pick up my son.

M: Did you hear about the air crash that occurred in South America recently? It was quite a tragic accident!
W: No, I didn’t see anything in the news about it. What happened?
M: A foreign airliner was attempting to land at night in a mountainous area in Argentina and flew into a hill!
W: That sounds really terrible! Did anyone survive?
M: No, everyone aboard, including the crew, was killed instantly.
W: What were the circumstances? Were they bad weather, a fire, or engine failure?
M: Apparently, there were some low clouds in the area, but mostly it was just miscommunication between the pilots and the traffic controllers.
W: Weren’t they both speaking in English, the official international aviation language?
M: Yes they were, but the transmit ion from poor quality radios was slightly distorted and the accents of the Spanish speaking controllers was so strong that the pilots that the pilots misunderstood a vital instruction.
W: How could a misunderstanding like that cause such a serious accident?
M: The pilots were told to descend to 2-2,000 feet. The instruction actually meant 22,000 feet, but they thought they heard descend 2,000 feet. That’s a huge difference, and it should have been confirmed, but it was not. Unfortunately, the terrain of the mountains in Norweija ascends to 2,000 feet.
W: So the pilots did descend to the wrong altitude then, because they were following the air controllers instructions.
M: Sadly enough, yes they did. It was a really bad mistake. Many people died as a result of the simply understanding.
W: Wow, that’s a powerful lesson on how important it can be to accurately communicate to each other.
Questions: 23-25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

Passage one
Edgar Poe, an American writer, was born in 1809. His parents were actors. Edgar was a baby when his father left the family. He was two years old when his mother died. He was taken into the home of a wealthy business man named John Allen. He then received his real name, Edgar Allen Poe. As a young man, Poe attended the University of Virginia. He was a good student, but he liked to drink alcohol and play card games for money. As an unskilled game player, he often lost money. Since he couldn’t pay off his gambling money, he left university and began working for magazines. He worked hard, yet he was not well paid, or well known. At the age of 27, he got married. For a time it seemed that Poe would find happiness, but his wife was sick for most of their marriage, and died in 1847. Through all his crises, Poe produced many stories and poems which appeared in different publications, yet he didn’t become famous until 1845, when his poem, The Raven, was published. There is a question, however, about Poe’s importance in American Literature. Some critics say that Poe was one of America’s best writers, and even influenced many French writers, but others disagree. They say that Poe’s work is difficult to understand and most of his writing describes many unpleasant situations and events. Edgar Allen Poe died in 1849 when he was 40 years old. It is said that he was found dead after days of heavy drinking.
Questions 26-29 are based on the passage you have just heard.
26.	What happened to Edgar Allen Poe’s family, when he was only two years old?
27.	Why did Edgar Allen Poe leave the University of Virginia?
28.	What do some critics say about Edgar Allen Poe?
29.	How did Edgar Allen Poe’s life come to an end?
Passage Two
More than fifty years ago, the United Nations declared that literacy is a basic human right. It’s very important for improving the lives of individuals, however, it is estimated that 880 million adults around the world are illiterate, that is, they are unable to read or write. A majority of them are women. Over 100 million school age children around the world do not attend school. Many others complete school of fail to finish their studies without learning to read or write. Many countries depend on the efforts of people who offer their time to help illiterate individuals. For example, John Mogger became concerned about the problem of illiteracy three years ago, so he started teaching five prisoners in Brazil. In his teaching, he developed a system with these prisoners. He says his way of teaching can help anyone learn how to read and write with about thirty hours of study. To learn his system, people must first know how to write letters of the alphabet and learn which sounds they represent. The system divides letters into three groups. The first group of letter can be written between two lines. The second can be written between two lines but part of the letter is above the top line. The third group has letters that are partly written below the lower line. John Mogger taught his students to write simply words from the letters, in this way, his students learned more than seven hundred words. Many of them can now write to family members. They also can read newspapers and magazines.
Questions 30-32 are based on the Passage you have just heard.
30.	According to the speaker, which group of people makes up the majority of the illiterate population?
31.	What is the most important feature of John Moggers method of teaching the alphabet?
32.	What does John Mogger say about his teaching method?
Passage Three
Farmers usually use plows to prepare their fields for planting crops. Plows cut into the ground, and lift up weeds, and other unwanted plants. However, plowing is blamed for causing severe damage to top soil by removing the plants that protect soil from being blown or washed away. Many farmers in South Asia are now trying a process called Low Till Farming. Low Till Farming limits the use of plows. In this method of farming seeds and fertilizer are put into the soil through small cuts made in the surface of the ground. Low Till Agriculture leaves much or all the soil and remains of plants on the ground. They serve as a natural fertilizer and help support the roots of future crops. They take in rain and allow it to flow into the soil instead of running off. It has been proved that Low Till Farming increases harvests and reduces water use, and this method reduced the need for chemical products because there are fewer unwanted plants. Scientists say Low Till Farming is becoming popular in South Asia, which is facing a sever water shortage. They say the area will become depended on imported food unless water is saved through methods like Low Till Farming. Currently, more than 150 million people in South Asia depend on local rice and wheat crops. Farmers grow rice during wet weather. During the dry season they grow wheat in the same fields. Farmers are using the Low Till method to plant wheat after harvesting rice. Scientists say Low Till Agriculture is one of the best examples in the worlds of technologies working for both people, and the environment.
Questions 33-35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33.	What is the main problem cause by the usual way of plowing?
34.	What does the speaker say about Low Till Farming?
35.	Where is Low Till Farming becoming popular?
Passage One
Adults are getting smarter about how smart babies are. Not long ago, researches learned that four day olds could understand addition and subtraction. Now, British research psychologist Gram Shaffer has discovered that infants can learn words or uncommon things long before they can speak. He found that nine month old infants could be taught through repeated show and tell to recognize the names of objects that were foreign to them, a result that challenges in some ways, the received wisdom that apart from learning to identify things common to their daily lives, children don’t being to build vocabulary until well into their second year. “It’s no secret that children learn words, but the words they tend to know are linked to specific situations in the home,” explains Shaffer. This is the first demonstration that we can choose what words the children will learn and that they can respond to them with an unfamiliar voice giving instructions in an unfamiliar setting. “Figuring out how human acquire language may shed light on why some children learn to read and write later than others,” Shaffer says, “and could lead to better treatments for developed mental problems.” What’s more, the study of language acquisition offers direct insight into how humans learn. “Language is a test case for human cognitive development,” says Shaffer, “but parents eager to teach their infants should take note. Even without being taught new words a control group caught up with the other infants within a few months.” This is not about advancing development, he says, it’s just about what children can do at an earlier age than what educators have often thought.

Seven Steps to a More Fulfilling Job
Many people today find themselves in unfulfilling work situations. In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent “Plans for 2004” survey. Their career path may be financially rewarding, but it doesn’t meet their emotional, social or creative needs. They’re stuck, unhappy, and have no idea what to do about it, except move to another job.
Mary Lyn Miller, veteran career consultant and founder of the Life and Career Clinic, says that when most people are unhappy about their work, their first thought is to get a different job. Instead, Miller suggests looking at the possibility of a different life. Through her book, 8 Myths of Making a Living, as well as workshops, seminars and personal coaching and consulting, she has helped thousands of dissatisfied workers reassess life and work.
Like the way of Zen, which includes understanding of oneself as one really is, Miller encourages job seekers  and those dissatisfied with work or life to examine their beliefs about work and recognize that “in many cases your beliefs are what brought you to where you are today.” You may have been raised to think that women were best at nurturing and caring and, therefore, should be teachers and nurses. So that’s what you did. Or, perhaps you were brought up to believe that you should do what your father did, so you have taken over the family business, or become a dentist “just like dad.” If this sounds familiar, it’s probably time to look at the new possibilities for your future.
Miller developed a 7-step process to help potential job seekers assess their current situation and beliefs, identify their real passion, and start on a journey that allows them to pursue their passion through work.
Step 1: Willingness to do something different.
Breaking the cycle of doing what you have always done is one of the most difficult tasks for job seekers. Many find it difficult to steer away from a career path or make a change, even if it doesn’t feel right. Miller urges job seekers to open their minds to other possibilities beyond what they are currently doing.
Step 2: Commitment to being who you are, not who or what someone wants you to be.
Look at the \gifts and talents you have and make a commitment to pursue those things that you love most. If you love the social aspects of your job, but are stuck inside an office or “chained to your desk” most of the time, vow to follow your instinct and investigate alternative careers and work that allow you more time to interact with others. Dawn worked as a manager for a large retail clothing store for several years. Though she had advanced within the company, she felt frustrated and longed to be involved with nature and the outdoors. She decided to go to school nights and weekends to pursue her true passion by earning her master’s degree in forestry. She now works in the biotech forestry division of a major paper company.
Step 3: Self-definition
Miller suggests that once job seekers know who they are, they need to know how to sell themselves. “In the job market, you are a product. And just like a product, you most know the features and benefits that you have to offer a potential client, or employer.” Examine the skills and knowledge that you have identify how they can apply to your desired occupation. Your qualities will exhibit to employers why they should hire you over other candidates.
Step 4: Attain a level of self-honoring.
Self-honoring or self-love may seem like an odd step for job hunters, but being able to accept yourself, without judgment, helps eliminate insecurities and will make you more self-assured. By accepting who you are – all your emotions, hopes and dreams, your personality, and your unique way of being – you’ll project more confidence when networking and talking with potential employers. The power of self-honoring can help to break all the falsehoods you were programmed to believe – those that made you feel that you were not good enough, or strong enough, or intelligent enough to do what you truly desire.
Step 5: Vision.
Miller suggests that job seekers develop a vision that embraces the answer to “What do I really want to do?” one should create a solid statement in a dozen or so sentences that describe in detail how they see their life related to work. For instance, the secretary who longs to be an actress describes a life that allows her to express her love of Shakespeare on stage. A real estate agent, attracted to his current job because her loves fixing up old homes, describes buying properties that need a little tender loving care to make them more saleable.
Step 6: Appropriate risk.
Some philosophers believe that the way to enlightenment comes through facing obstacles and difficulties. Once people discover their passion, many are too scared to do anything about it. Instead, they do nothing. With this step, job seekers should assess what they are willing to give up, or risk, in pursuit of their dream. For one working mom, that meant taking night classes to learn new computer-aided design skills, while still earning a salary and keeping her day job. For someone else, it may mean quitting his or her job, taking out loan and going back to school full time. You’ll move one step closer to your ideal work life if you identify how much risk you are willing to take and the sacrifices you are willing to make.
Step 7: Action.
Some teachers of philosophy describe action in this way, “If one wants to get to the top of a mountain, just sitting at the foot thinking about it will not bring one there. It is by making the effort of climbing up the mountain, step by step, that eventually the summit is reached.” All too often, it is the lack of action that ultimately holds people back from attaining their ideals. Creating a plan and taking it one step at a time can lead to new and different job opportunities. Job-hunting tasks gain added meaning as you sense their importance in your quest for a more meaningful work life. The plan can include researching industries and occupations, talking to people who are in your desired area of work, taking classes, or accepting volunteer work in your targeted field.
Each of these steps will lead you on a journey to a happier and more rewarding work life. After all, it is the journey, not the destination, that is most important.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions:	In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
Google is a world-famous company, with its headquarters in Mountain View, California. It was set up in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998, and  inflated (膨胀) with the Internet bubble. Even when everything around it collapsed the company kept on inflating. Google’s search engine is so widespread across the world that search became Google, and google became a verb. The world fell in love with the effective, fascinatingly fast technology.
Google owes much of its success to the brilliance of S. Brin and L. Page, but also to a series of fortunate events. It was Page who, at Stanford in 1996, initiated  the academic project that eventually became Google’s search engine. Brin, who had met Page at a student orientation a year earlier, joined the project early on. They were both Ph.D. candidates when they devised the search engine which was better than the rest and, without any marketing, spread by word of mouth from early adopters to, eventually, your grandmother.
Their breakthrough, simply put, was that when their search engine crawled the Web, it did more than just look for word matches, it also tallied (统计) and ranked a host of other critical factors like how websites link to one another. That delivered far better results than anything else. Brin and  Page meant to name their creation Googol (the mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes), but someone misspelled the word so it stuck as Google. They raised money from prescient (有先见之明的) professors and venture capitalists, and moved off campus to turn Google into business. Perhaps their biggest stroke of luck came early on when they tried to sell their technology to other search engines, but no one met their price, and they built it up on their own.
The next breakthrough came in 2000, when Google figured out how to make money with its invention. It had lots of users, but almost no one was paying. The solution turned out to be advertising, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that Google is now essentially an advertising company, given that that’s the source of nearly all its revenue. Today it is a giant advertising company, worth $100 billion.

Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
You hear the refrain all the time: the U.S. economy looks good statistically, but it doesn’t feel good. Why doesn’t ever-greater wealth promote ever-greater happiness? It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 of The Affluent (富裕的) Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, who died recently at 97.
The Affluent Society is a modern classic because it helped define a new moment in the human condition. For most of history, “hunger, sickness, and cold” threatened nearly everyone, Galbraith wrote. “Poverty was found everywhere in that world. Obviously it is not of ours.” After World War II, the dread of another Great Depression gave way to an economic boom. In the 1930s unemployment had averaged 18.2 percent; in the 1950s it was 4.5 percent.
To Galbraith, materialism had gone mad and would breed discontent. Through advertising, companies conditioned consumers to buy things they didn’t really want or need. Because so much spending was artificial, it would  be unfulfilling. Meanwhile, government spending that would make everyone better off was being cut down because people instinctively—and wrongly—labeled government only as “a necessary evil.”
It’s often said that only the rich are getting ahead; everyone else is  standing still or falling behind. Well, there are many undeserving rich—overpaid chief executives, for instance. But over any meaningful period, most people’s incomes are increasing. From 1995 to 2004, inflation-adjusted average family income rose 14.3 percent, to $43,200. people feel “squeezed” because their rising incomes often don’t satisfy their rising wants—for bigger homes, more health care, more education, faster Internet connections.
The other great frustration is that it has not eliminated insecurity. People regard job stability as part of their standard of living. As corporate layoffs increased, that part has eroded. More workers fear they’ve become “the disposable American,” as Louis Uchitelle puts it in his book by the same name.
Because so much previous suffering and social conflict stemmed from poverty, the arrival of widespread affluence suggested utopian (乌托邦式的) possibilities. Up to a point, affluence succeeds. There is much les physical misery than before. People are better off. Unfortunately, affluence also creates new complaints and contradictions.
Advanced societies need economic growth to satisfy the multiplying wants of their citizens. But the quest for growth lets loose new anxieties and economic conflicts that disturb the social order. Affluence liberates the individual, promising that everyone can choose a unique way to self-fulfillment. But the promise is so extravagant that it predestines many disappointments and sometimes inspires choices that have anti-social consequences, including family breakdown and obesity (肥胖症). Statistical indicators of happiness have not risen with incomes.
Should we be surprised? Not really. We’ve simply reaffirmed an old truth: the pursuit of affluence does not always end with happiness.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
The use of deferential (敬重的) language is symbolic of the Confucian ideal of the woman, which dominates conservative gender norms in Japan. This ideal presents a woman who withdraws quietly to the background, subordinating her life and needs to those of her family and its male head. She is a dutiful daughter, wife, and mother, master of the domestic arts. The typical refined Japanese woman excels in modesty and delicacy; she “treads softly (谨言慎行)in the world,” elevating feminine beauty and grace to an art form.
Nowadays, it is commonly observed that young women are not conforming to the feminine linguistic (语言的) ideal. They are using fewer of the very deferential “women’s” forms, and even using the few strong forms that are know as “men’s.” This, of course, attracts considerable attention and has led to an outcry in the Japanese media against the defeminization of women’s language. Indeed, we didn’t hear about “men’s language” until people began to respond to girls’ appropriation of forms normally reserved for boys and men. There is considerable sentiment about the “corruption” of women’s language—which of course is viewed as part of the loss of feminine ideals and morality—and this sentiment is crystallized by nationwide opinion polls that are regularly carried out by the media.
Yoshiko Matsumoto has argued that young women probably never used as many of the highly deferential forms as older women. This highly polite style is no doubt something that young women have been expected to “grow into”—after all, it is assign not simply of femininity, but of maturity and refinement, and its use could be taken to indicate a change in the nature of one’s social relations as well. One might well imagine little girls using exceedingly polite forms when playing house or imitating older women—in a fashion analogous to little girls’ use of a high-pitched voice to do “teacher talk” or “mother talk” in role play.
The fact that young Japanese women are using less deferential language is a sure sign of change—of social change and of linguistic change. But it is most certainly not a sign of the “masculization” of girls. In some instances, it may be a sign that girls are making the same claim to authority as boys and men, but that is very different from saying that they are trying to be “masculine.” Katsue Reynolds has argued that girls nowadays are using more assertive language strategies in order to be able to compete with boys in schools and out. Social change also brings not simply different positions for women and girls, but different relations to life stages, and adolescent girls are participating in new subcultural forms. Thus what may, to an older speaker, seem like “masculine” speech may seem to an adolescent like “liberated” or “hip” speech.

11.	W: Jim, you are on the net again? When are you going to get off? It’s the time for the talk show.
M: Just a minute, dear. I’m looking at a new jewelry site. I want to make sure I get the right gift for Mum’s birthday.
Q: What is the man doing right now?
12.	W: I’ve never seen you have such confidence before an exam.
M: It’s more than confidence. Right now I feel that if I get less than an A, it’ll be the fault of the exam itself.
Q: What does the man mean?
13.	W: Just look at this newspaper, nothing but murder, death and war! Do you still believe people are basically good?
M: Of course I do. But newspapers hardly ever report stories about peace and generosity. They are not news.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
14.	M: Tom must be joking when he said he plans to sell his shop and go to medical school.
W: You are quite right. He is just kidding. He’s also told me time and time again he wished he’d studied for some profession instead of going into business.
Q: What will Tom probably do according to the conversation?
15.	W: I hear your boss has a real good impression of you and he is thinking about giving you two more days off each month.
M: I hope not. I’d rather get more work hours so I can get enough bucks to help out my two kids at college.
Q: What does the man truly want?
16.	M: I heard you took a trip to Mexico last month. How did you like it?
W: Oh, I got sick and tired of hotels and hotel food. So now I understand the saying, “East, west, home’s best”.
Q: What does the woman mean?
17.	W: I’m worried about Anna. She is really been depressed lately. All she does is staying in her room all day.
M: That sounds serious. She’d better see a psychiatrist at the consoling center.
Q: What does the man suggest Anna do?
18.	M: I could hardly recognize Sam after he got that new job. He’s always in a suit and a tie now.
W: Yeah, he was never like that at college. Back then he would’ve run in an old T-shirt and jeans.
Q: What do the speakers say about Sam?
Conversation One
M: Hi, Ann, welcome back. How’s your trip to the states?
W: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings. So, of course, I didn’t have much time to see New York.
M: What a pity. Actually I have a trip there myself next week.
W: Do you? Then take my advice. Do the well-being in the air program. It really works.
M: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works?
W: Yes. I did the program on the flight to the States. And when I arrived in New York, I didn’t have any problem. No jet leg at all. On the way back I didn’t do it, and I felt terrible.
M: You are joking.
W: Not at all. It really made a lot of difference.
M: Hmm…So, what did you do?
W: Well, I didn’t drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn’t eat any meat or rich food. I drink a lot of water and fruit juice and I eat the meals on the well-being menu. They are lighter. They have fish, vegetables and noodles, for example. And I did some of the exercises in the program.
M: Exercises? On a plane?
W: Yes. I didn’t do many, of course. There isn’t much space on the plane.
M: How many passengers did the exercises?
W: Not many.
M: And how much champagne did they drink?
W: A lot. It was more popular than mineral water.
M: So, basically it’s a choice. Mineral water and exercises or champagne and jet lag.
W: That’s right. It’s a difficult choice.

Conversation Two
W: Morning. Can I help you?
M: Well, I’m not really sure. I’m just looking.
W: I see. Well, there’s plenty to look at again this year. I’m sure you’d have to walk miles to see each stand.
M: That’s true.
W: Would you like a coffee? Come and sit down for a minute. No obligation.
M: Well, that’s very kind of you. But…
W: No, please, is this the first year you’ve been to the fair, Mr. …?
M: Yes. Johnson. James Johnson.
W: My name’s Susan Carter. Are you looking for anything in particular or are you just interested in computers in general?
M: Well, actually, I have some specific jobs in mind. I own a small company. We’ve grown quite dramatically over the past 12 months and we really need some technological help to enable us to keep on top of everything.
W: What’s your line of business, Mr. Johnson?
M: We are a training consultancy.
W: I see. And what do you need to keep on top?
M: The first thing is correspondence. We have a lot f standard letters and forms. So I suppose we need some kind of word processor.
W: Right. Well, that’s no problem. But it may be possible for you to get a system that does a lot of other things in addition to word processing. What might suit you is the MR5000. That’s over there. It’s IBM compatible.
M: What about the price?
W: Well, the MR5000 costs 1,050 pounds. Software comes free with the hardware.
M: Well, I’ll think about it. Thank you.
W: Here’s my card. Please feel free to contact me.

Passage One
The New Year always brings with it a cultural tradition of new possibilities. We see it as a chance for renewal. We begin to dream of new possible selves. We design our ideal self or an image that is quite different from what we are now. For some of us, we roll that dreamy film in our heads just because it is the beginning of the New Year, but we are serious about making changes. We just make some half hard resolution and it evaporates after a week or two. The experience makes us less successful and leads us to discount ability to change in the future. It’s not the changes impossible, but it won’t last unless our resolutions are supported with plans for implementation. We have to make our intensions manageable by detailing the specific steps that will carry us to our goal.
Say your goal is to lose weight by dieting and cutting off sweets. But one night you just have to have a cookie and you know there is a bag of your favorites in the cupboard. You want one, you eat two, you check the bag and find out that you’ve just shot 132 calories. You say to yourself, “What the hell. I’ll polish off the whole bag.” Then you begin to draw all kinds of unpleasant conclusions about yourself. To protect your sense of yourself, you begin to discount the goal. You may think, “Well, dieting wasn’t that important to me and I wouldn’t make it anyhow.” So you’ll abandon the goal and return to your bad habits.

26.	What do people usually wish to do at the beginning of the New Year?
27.	How can people turn their New Year’s resolutions into reality?

Passage Two
25 years ago, Ray Anderson, a single parent with a one-year-old son, witnessed a terrible accident, which took place when the driver of a truck ran a red light and collided it with the car of Sandra Drinkens. The impact of the collision killed Sandra instantly, but her three-month-old daughter was left trapped in the burning car. While others looked on in horror, Anderson jumped out of his vehicle and crawled into the car through the shattered rear window to try to free the infant. Seconds later, the car was enclosed in flames, but to everyone’s amazement, Anderson was able to pull the baby to safety. While the baby was all right, Anderson was seriously injured. Two days later, he died. But his heroic act was published widely in the media. His son was soon adopted by relatives.
The most remarkable part of this story unfolded only last week. Karen and her boyfriend Michael were looking through some old boxes when they came across some old newspaper clippings. “This is me when I was a new born baby. I was rescued from a burning car but my mother died in the accident,’’ explained Karen. Although Michael knew Karen’s mother had died years earlier, he never fully understood the circumstances until he skimmed over the news paper article. To Karen’s surprise, Michael was absorbed in the details of the accident and he began to cry uncontrollably. Then he revealed that the man that pulled Karen from the flames was the father he never knew. The two embraced and shed many tears, recounting stories told to them about their parents.
Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you’ve just heard.

30.	What does the speaker say about Michael’s father?
31.	Why did Michael cry uncontrollably when he skimmed over the newspaper article?
Passage Three
Americans suffer from an overdose of work. Regardless of who they are or what they do, Americans spend more time at work than at any time since World War II. In 1950, the US had fewer working hours than any other industrialized country. Today it exceeds any country but Japan, where industrial employees log 2,155 hours a year, compared with 1,951 in the US, and 1,603 in the former West Germany. Between 1969 and 1989 employed Americans added an average of 138 hours to their yearly work schedules. The work week has remained at about 40 hours, but people are working more weeks each year. Specifically, paid time off, holidays, vacations, sick leave shrank by 50% in the 1980’s. As co-operations have experienced stiff competition and slower growth productivity, they have pressed employees to work longer. Cost cutting lay-offs in the 1980’s reduced the professional and managerial ranks leaving fewer people to get the job done. In lower paid occupations, when wages have been reduced, workers have added hours in overtime or extra jobs to preserve their living standards. The government estimates that more than 7 million people hold a second job. For the first time, large numbers of people say they want to cut back on working hours even if it means earning less money. But most employers are unwilling to let them to do so. The government, which has stepped back from its traditional role as a regulator of work time should take steps to make shorter hours possible.
Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
32.	In which country do the employees work the longest hours?
33.	How do employed Americans manage to work more hours?
34.	Why do corporations press the employees to work longer hours according to the speaker?
35.	What does the speaker say many Americans prefer to do?
Compound Dictation
Nursing, as a typically female profession, must deal constantly with the false impression that nurses are there to wait on the position. As nurses, we are licensed to provide nursing care only. We do not have any legal or moral obligation to any physician. We provide health teaching, assess physical as well as emotional problems, coordinate patient-related services and make all of our nursing decisions based upon what is best or suitable for the patient. If, in any circumstance, we feel that the physician’s order is inappropriate or unsafe, we have a legal responsibility to question that order or refuse to carry it out. Nursing is not a nine-to-five job with every weekend off. All nurses are aware of that before they enter the profession. The emotional and physical stress, however, that occurs due to hard working hours is a prime reason for a lot of the career for dissatisfaction. It is sometimes required that we work overtime and that we change shifts four or five times a month. That disturbs our personal lives, disrupts our sleeping and eating habits, and isolates us from everything except job-related friends and activities. The quality of nursing care is being affected dramatically by these situations. Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates as experienced nurses finally give up trying to change the system. Consumers of medically-related services have evidently not been affected enough yet to demand changes in our medical system. But if trends continue as predicted, they will find that most critical hospital care will be provided by new, inexperienced and sometimes inadequately-trained nurses.
